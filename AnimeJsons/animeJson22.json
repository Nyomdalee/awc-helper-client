Shocked with the lack of decent individuals at his new residence, Kazunari is about to leave when he runs into shy senior student Ritsu Kawai and finds himself slowly falling in love with her.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.66,"Rank":1254,"Popularity":585,"Genres":[{"Id":36,"Name":"Slice of Life"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":74,"Name":"Romantic Subtext"},{"Id":23,"Name":"School"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":42,"Name":"Seinen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2014,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1440,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":17392,"Completed":242787,"OnHold":8497,"Dropped":9863,"PlanToWatch":98136,"Total":376675},"Favorites":2210,"Producers":["TBS"],"Licensors":["Sentai Filmworks"],"Studios":["Brain\u0027s Base"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Itsuka no, Ikutsuka no Kimi to no Sekai (\u3044\u3064\u304B\u306E\u3001\u3044\u304F\u3064\u304B\u306E\u304D\u307F\u3068\u306E\u305B\u304B\u3044)\u0022 by fh\u00E1na"],"Endings":["\u0022My Sweet Shelter\u0022 by Ritsu Kawai (CV: Kana Hanazawa), Mayumi Nishikino (CV: Rina Satou), Sayaka Watanabe (CV: Hisako Kanemoto)"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=10288","LastUpdated":"2023-09-08T22:18:02.8269908Z"},{"Id":21407,"Title":"Happiness Charge Precure!","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1973/94568.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2014,"Month":2,"Day":2,"Full":"2014-02-02"},"EndDate":{"Year":2015,"Month":1,"Day":25,"Full":"2015-01-25"},"Synopsis":"Some time ago, the opening of a box known as the \u0022Axia\u0022 set loose the previously sealed members of the Phantom Empire into the world.

Although they harbor no ill intentions towards humans, many suffer from the side effects of their existence and strange nature; exploiting the Mushi without understanding them, even unintentionally, can lead to disaster and strife for any involved. Mushishi Zoku Shou continues the story of Mushishi Ginko on his journey to help the visible world to coexist with the Mushi.\n\nDuring his travels, Ginko discovers various gifted individuals\u2014those cursed by circumstance and those maintaining a fragile symbiosis with the Mushi\u2014inevitably confronting the question of whether humanity, talented and tortured alike, can manage the responsibility of the unseen. Moreover, as a Mushishi, Ginko must learn more about these strange beings and decide if he has the right to interfere with the complex relationships between Mushi and mankind.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":8.7,"Rank":55,"Popularity":784,"Genres":[{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":7,"Name":"Mystery"},{"Id":36,"Name":"Slice of Life"},{"Id":37,"Name":"Supernatural"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":50,"Name":"Adult Cast"},{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"},{"Id":63,"Name":"Iyashikei"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":42,"Name":"Seinen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":10,"StartSeason":{"Year":2014,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Saturday","StartTime":"00:00"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1440,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":15461,"Completed":143239,"OnHold":7595,"Dropped":3389,"PlanToWatch":121429,"Total":291113},"Favorites":1536,"Producers":["Aniplex","Kodansha","Delfi Sound"],"Licensors":["Aniplex of America"],"Studios":["Artland"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Shiver\u0022 by Lucy Rose"],"Endings":["1: \u0022Nozue no Utage (\u91CE\u672B\u306E\u5BB4)\u0022 by Toshio Masuda (eps 1)","2: \u0022Saezuru Kai (\u56C0\u308B\u8C9D)\u0022 by Toshio Masuda (eps 2)","3: \u0022Yuki no Shita (\u96EA\u306E\u4E0B)\u0022 by Toshio Masuda (eps 3)","4: \u0022Yoru wo Naderu Te (\u591C\u3092\u64AB\u3067\u308B\u624B)\u0022 by Toshio Masuda (eps 4)","5: \u0022Kagami ga Fuchi (\u93E1\u304C\u6DF5)\u0022 by Toshio Masuda (eps 5)","6: \u0022Hana Madoi (\u82B1\u60D1\u3044)\u0022 by Toshio Masuda (eps 6)","7: \u0022Hi Teru Ame (\u65E5\u7167\u308B\u96E8)\u0022 by Toshio Masuda (eps 7)","8: \u0022Shimaki Tatsu (\u98A8\u5DFB\u7ACB\u3064)\u0022 by Toshio Masuda (eps 8)","9: \u0022Ushio Waku Tani (\u6F6E\u308F\u304F\u8C37)\u0022 by Toshio Masuda (eps 9)","10: \u0022Fuyu no Soko (\u51AC\u306E\u5E95)\u0022 by Toshio Masuda (eps 10)"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=10384","LastUpdated":"2023-09-08T22:18:02.8300867Z"},{"Id":21941,"Title":"Sore Ike!

Unfortunately, that spell abruptly ended on a sour note when he suddenly stopped attending school and never came back. When Futaba finds out that Kou has returned\u2014with a different last name this time\u2014she can already feel the butterflies in her stomach. However, Kou Mabuchi is not the warm boy that she remembers from her days in middle school; he is now taller, more charismatic and withdrawn\u2014making him far less approachable.\n\nFutaba believes that if she returns to her former self, Kou will begin to take notice of her again.
