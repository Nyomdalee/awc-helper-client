Fueled by unknown feelings of hatred, he vows to fight for survival. As he struggles to escape from a relentless pursuer, he finds a crimson blade plunged into the ground; and by pulling it out, Hakuno summons his own Servant, Saber, who instantly destroys his pursuer in a flurry of rose petals.

An asphalt concrete highway runs through the area, used from time to time by various cargo trucks. Oscar is generally searching for food or water; he sometimes discovers liquid, in bottles or elsewhere, but is usually frustrated from recovering it for drink. An oasis supplies the only fresh water in the area, but its thick population of irascible and hungry crocodiles renders it inaccessible. At considerable personal risk (lizard is a delicacy for chickens), Oscar occasionally manages to steal an egg from a nearby hen coop, and he sometimes explores one of the piles of trash that litter the parched landscape. Popy, a fennec fox; Buck, a vulture; and Harchi, a hyena, inhabit a derelict school bus situated on a neighboring hill, but they mostly race about on a cast-off warehouse or grocery cart powered by Harchi and directed by Popy. Like Oscar, the trio constantly search for food and water - often competing with him, sometimes abusing him as a means, but occasionally cooperating with him when it suits their purpose. The main characters often find themselves falling off cliffs a la Wile E. Coyote chasing the Road Runner, wherein the law of gravity is briefly suspended while the character comes to realize their imminent doom.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","Mean":6.48,"Rank":6720,"Popularity":11384,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":78,"StartSeason":{"Year":2011,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Unknown","AverageEpisodeDuration":480,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Watching":68,"Completed":1129,"OnHold":50,"Dropped":169,"PlanToWatch":205,"Total":1621},"Favorites":5,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["TUBA"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=13584","LastUpdated":"2023-09-08T22:18:02.9948482Z"},{"Id":33431,"Title":"Vicky and Johnny","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1974/135549.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2007,"Month":1,"Day":1,"Full":"2007"},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"2007"},"Synopsis":"The series follows Vicky and Johnny, two exuberant children who become involved in several boy vs. girl matches.","Mean":null,"Rank":13619,"Popularity":19981,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[{"Id":15,"Name":"Kids"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":104,"StartSeason":null,"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":110,"Rating":"PG","Statistics":{"Watching":11,"Completed":74,"OnHold":2,"Dropped":32,"PlanToWatch":35,"Total":154},"Favorites":0,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["TUBA"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2023-09-08T22:18:02.994867Z"},{"Id":33433,"Title":"Shuumatsu no Izetta","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/82119.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2016,"Month":10,"Day":1,"Full":"2016-10-01"},"EndDate":{"Year":2016,"Month":12,"Day":17,"Full":"2016-12-17"},"Synopsis":"After Germania invaded a neighboring country in 1939, Europe spiraled into a devastating war. During the war, Germania set its sights on the weak alpine country of Elystadt. Boasting a far superior military and having achieved profuse success earlier in the war, it was expected that Germania would conquer Elystadt with ease.\n\nMatters are only made worse for the small country when Germanian soldiers capture their princess, Ortfin\u00E9 \u0022Fin\u00E9\u0022 Fredericka von Eylstadt, as she is heading to a crucial meeting with Britannia. Yet, when a concurrent Germanian transport mission goes awry, Izetta, the last witch alive, escapes. When she recognizes Princess Fin\u00E9 from her childhood, Izetta rescues her from the Germanian soldiers by making use of her magical abilities. Now reunited with the princess, Izetta pledges to protect Elystadt from Germania, and with the last surviving witch on their arsenal, Elystadt hopes to turn the tides against the imperialist war giant. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":6.75,"Rank":5249,"Popularity":1295,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"},{"Id":38,"Name":"Military"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2016,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Saturday","StartTime":"23:00"},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":1545,"Rating":"R","Statistics":{"Watching":15311,"Completed":76810,"OnHold":8900,"Dropped":19044,"PlanToWatch":54066,"Total":174131},"Favorites":342,"Producers":["Shochiku","AT-X","Asahi Production","flying DOG","Tokyo MX","i0\u002B","Wargaming Japan","JTB Entertainment","RAY"],"Licensors":["Funimation","Crunchyroll"],"Studios":["Ajia-do"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022cross the line\u0022 by AKINO with bless4"],"Endings":["\u0022Hikari Aru Basho e (\u5149\u3042\u308B\u5834\u6240\u3078)\u0022 by May\u0027n"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=12201","LastUpdated":"2023-09-08T22:18:02.994893Z"},{"Id":33434,"Title":"Heybot!","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/82258.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2016,"Month":9,"Day":18,"Full":"2016-09-18"},"EndDate":{"Year":2017,"Month":9,"Day":24,"Full":"2017-09-24"},"Synopsis":"The anime takes place on the screw-shaped island country of Nejigajima and follows the two \u0022Bokyabots\u0022 Hebot and the Yurui Prince Nejiru as they collect different \u0022Bokya Neji\u0022 screws.
