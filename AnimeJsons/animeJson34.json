The dragon immediately transforms into a cute, busty, and energetic young girl dressed in a maid outfit, introducing herself as Tooru.\n\nIt turns out that the stoic programmer had come across the dragon the previous night on a drunken excursion to the mountains, and since the mythical beast had nowhere else to go, she had offered the creature a place to stay in her home. Thus, Tooru had arrived to cash in on the offer, ready to repay her savior\u0027s kindness by working as her personal maidservant.

An asphalt concrete highway runs through the area, used from time to time by various cargo trucks. Oscar is generally searching for food or water; he sometimes discovers liquid, in bottles or elsewhere, but is usually frustrated from recovering it for drink. An oasis supplies the only fresh water in the area, but its thick population of irascible and hungry crocodiles renders it inaccessible. At considerable personal risk (lizard is a delicacy for chickens), Oscar occasionally manages to steal an egg from a nearby hen coop, and he sometimes explores one of the piles of trash that litter the parched landscape. Popy, a fennec fox; Buck, a vulture; and Harchi, a hyena, inhabit a derelict school bus situated on a neighboring hill, but they mostly race about on a cast-off warehouse or grocery cart powered by Harchi and directed by Popy. Like Oscar, the trio constantly search for food and water - often competing with him, sometimes abusing him as a means, but occasionally cooperating with him when it suits their purpose. The main characters often find themselves falling off cliffs a la Wile E. Coyote chasing the Road Runner, wherein the law of gravity is briefly suspended while the character comes to realize their imminent doom.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","Mean":6.47,"Rank":6781,"Popularity":11362,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":78,"StartSeason":{"Year":2011,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Unknown","AverageEpisodeDuration":480,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":66,"Completed":1120,"OnHold":51,"Dropped":169,"PlanToWatch":206},"NumListUsers":1612},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T13:18:35.65+02:00"},{"Id":33431,"Title":"Vicky and Johnny","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1974/135549.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1974/135549l.jpg"},"StartDate":"2007","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2007,"Month":null,"Day":null},"EndDate":"2007","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2007,"Month":null,"Day":null},"Synopsis":"The series follows Vicky and Johnny, two exuberant children who become involved in several boy vs. girl matches.","Mean":null,"Rank":13552,"Popularity":19999,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":15,"Name":"Kids"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":104,"StartSeason":{"Year":null,"Season":null},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":110,"Rating":"PG","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":10,"Completed":70,"OnHold":2,"Dropped":32,"PlanToWatch":35},"NumListUsers":149},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T13:18:36.381+02:00"},{"Id":33433,"Title":"Shuumatsu no Izetta","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/82119.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/82119l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Oct 01 2016","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2016,"Month":10,"Day":1},"EndDate":"Dec 17 2016","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2016,"Month":12,"Day":17},"Synopsis":"After Germania invaded a neighboring country in 1939, Europe spiraled into a devastating war.

Though shocked that her father is trusting her with such a major project so soon, Tsumugi vows to do everything she can to support the seven young boys. After seeing how well the boys work as a team, Tsumugi meets with her father and learns that her first job as manager will be to cut four boys from the group. This is because her father believes seven idols are too much to manage, and the current top group, TRIGGER, only has three members.\n\nAfter holding an impromptu audition, Tsumugi returns to her father and boldly declares that she refuses to cut anyone from the group, as each member has a unique allure which collectively enhances the group\u0027s appeal. She returns to the boys and they are thrilled that none of them will get to miss out on their dreams. Together they become IDOLiSH7, and prepare to take on the fiercely competitive world of idols.\n\n[Written by MAL
