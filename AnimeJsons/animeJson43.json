Growing doubtful, he freed the fox spirit to save the girl. As a punishment for his transgression, Jiang Ziya was banished to the North Sea, with his divine power sealed, until he would no longer be plagued by the Nine-Tailed\u0027s mirage.\n\nTen years later, Jiang Ziya dwells in the North Sea alongside his friend Shen Gongbao and his pet Si Bu Xiang. At a bar, Jiang Ziya meets Xiao Jiu\u2014who resembles the girl from the illusion.

Meanwhile, Sumire Suou is a promising rookie with exceptional talent\u2014a talent hindered by a team that cannot keep up with her abilities.\n\nOnda, convinced by her former coach to join a girls\u0027 soccer club, and Suou, accompanied by her close friend and rival Midori Soshizaki, cross paths as members of the Warabi Seinan High School\u0027s girls\u0027 soccer team.
