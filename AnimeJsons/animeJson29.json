Unable to experience individual thoughts or emotions, the corpses are programmed by humans to act as laborers in various occupations.\n\nThis newfound technology, however, comes with a catch. Science may be able to restore the corpses\u0027 ability to move, yet it cannot return what every corpse loses at death: the soul. But Doctor Victor Frankenstein, who vanished shortly after his revolutionary work on corpse reanimation, is said to have revived the only corpse in possession of a soul.\n\nIn pursuit of this scientific knowledge, London medical student John Watson hopes to fulfill his promise to his late partner, Friday. After being scouted by a government agency, Watson is on a hunt to obtain Frankenstein\u0027s notes, which he believes hold the key to the secrets of the soul. During his search, Watson uncovers the harsh realities of the developing corpse technology and the price he must pay to advance his research.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":6.85,"Rank":4776,"Popularity":2233,"Genres":[{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"},{"Id":40,"Name":"Psychological"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"}],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2015,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":7200,"Rating":"R","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":2923,"Completed":36198,"OnHold":1146,"Dropped":860,"PlanToWatch":40411},"NumListUsers":81538},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T00:28:16.972+02:00"},{"Id":28631,"Title":"Studio Khara vs. CyberConnect2 Gachinko!

For nine-year-old Ren, the last person who treated him with any form of kindness has been killed, and he is shunned by what is left of his family. With no parents, no real family, and no place to go, Ren escapes into the confusing streets and alleyways of Shibuya. Through the twists and turns of the alleys, Ren stumbles into the intimidating Kumatetsu, who leads him to the beast realm of Shibuten.\n\nFor Kumatetsu, the boy represents a chance for him to become a candidate to replace the lord of the realm once he retires. While nearly unmatched in combat, Kumatetsu\u0027s chilly persona leaves him with no disciples to teach and no way to prove he is worthy of becoming the lord\u0027s successor. \n\nWhile the two share different goals, they agree to help each other in order to reach them. Kumatetsu searches for recognition; Ren, now known as Kyuuta, searches for the home he never had. As the years pass by, it starts to become apparent that the two are helping each other in more ways than they had originally thought. Perhaps there has always been less of a difference between them, a boy and a beast, than either of the two ever realized.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":8.25,"Rank":298,"Popularity":521,"Genres":[{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":51,"Name":"Anthropomorphic"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"},{"Id":62,"Name":"Isekai"}],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2015,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":7140,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":9683,"Completed":280600,"OnHold":2821,"Dropped":1003,"PlanToWatch":117252},"NumListUsers":411359},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T00:31:24.395+02:00"},{"Id":28809,"Title":"Macross Fufonfia Specials","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/69531.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/69531l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Dec 25 2013","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2013,"Month":12,"Day":25},"EndDate":"Dec 25 2013","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2013,"Month":12,"Day":25},"Synopsis":"Three additional episodes of Macross Fufonfia released exclusively on the Digitally Remastered DVD/BD Box Set of Macross Frontier.","Mean":5.53,"Rank":11156,"Popularity":12463,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":20,"Name":"Parody"}],"MediaType":"Special","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":3,"StartSeason":{"Year":2013,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Unknown","AverageEpisodeDuration":181,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":53,"Completed":350,"OnHold":35,"Dropped":77,"PlanToWatch":583},"NumListUsers":1098},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T00:31:29.788+02:00"},{"Id":28811,"Title":"Last Exile: Doyou no Asa","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/69533.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/69533l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Dec 17 2011","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2011,"Month":12,"Day":17},"EndDate":"Jan 14 2012","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2012,"Month":1,"Day":14},"Synopsis":"A spinoff chibi flash animation style commercials of Last Exile: Ginyoku no Fam made specifically to promote the DVD/BD release of the main series.","Mean":5.62,"Rank":10877,"Popularity":11466,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":20,"Name":"Parody"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"}],"MediaType":"Special","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":3,"StartSeason":{"Year":2011,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Unknown","AverageEpisodeDuration":30,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":62,"Completed":529,"OnHold":41,"Dropped":89,"PlanToWatch":825},"NumListUsers":1546},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T00:31:30.857+02:00"},{"Id":28813,"Title":"Bamboo Blade: Fanfu-Fufe-Fo","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/69535.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/69535l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Apr 23 2008","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2008,"Month":4,"Day":23},"EndDate":"Jun 25 2008","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2008,"Month":6,"Day":25},"Synopsis":"Bamboo Blade specials released on DVD volumes 4 and 6.
