However, a small subset of the Knights supposedly betrayed their homeland and turned their blades against their comrades in an attempt to overthrow the ruler of Liones. They were defeated by the Holy Knights, but rumors continued to persist that these legendary knights, called the \u0022Seven Deadly Sins,\u0022 were still alive. Ten years later, the Holy Knights themselves staged a coup d\u2019\u00E9tat, and thus became the new, tyrannical rulers of the Kingdom of Liones.\n\nBased on the best-selling manga series of the same name, Nanatsu no Taizai follows the adventures of Elizabeth, the third princess of the Kingdom of Liones, and her search for the Seven Deadly Sins. With their help, she endeavors to not only take back her kingdom from the Holy Knights, but to also seek justice in an unjust world.\n \n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.66,"Rank":1253,"Popularity":31,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"},{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":24,"StartSeason":{"Year":2014,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Sunday","StartTime":"17:00"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1470,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":80451,"Completed":1658230,"OnHold":29453,"Dropped":55623,"PlanToWatch":166139},"NumListUsers":1989896},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-08T14:01:28.54+02:00"},{"Id":23759,"Title":"Oira no Ski","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/85247.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/85247l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Mar 07 1930","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":1930,"Month":3,"Day":7},"EndDate":"Mar 07 1930","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":1930,"Month":3,"Day":7},"Synopsis":"Animated short features bunnies and tanuki having wacky hijinks while going skiing.

He spends his days creating astounding pieces of art, from a giant-size Bodhidharma portrayed on a 180 square meter-wide sheet of paper, to a pair of sparrows painted on a tiny rice grain. Short-tempered, utterly sarcastic, with no passion for sake or money, he would charge a fortune for any job he is not really interested in.\n\nThird of Tetsuzo\u0027s four daughters and born out of his second marriage, outspoken 23-year-old O-Ei has inherited her father\u0027s talent and stubbornness, and very often she would paint instead of him, though uncredited. Her art is so powerful that sometimes leads to trouble. \u0022We\u0027re father and daughter; with two brushes and four chopsticks, I guess we can always manage, in a way or another.\u0022\n\nDecades later, Europe was going to discover the immense talent of Tetsuzo. He was to become best known by one of his many names: Katsushika Hokusai. He would mesmerize Renoir and van Gogh, Monet and Klimt.\n\nHowever, very few today are even aware of the woman who assisted him all his life, and greatly contributed to his art while remaining uncredited. This is the untold story of O-Ei, Master Hokusai\u0027s daughter: a lively portrayal of a free-spirited woman overshadowed by her larger-than-life father, unfolding through the changing seasons.\n\n(Source: Production I.G)","Mean":7.17,"Rank":3316,"Popularity":3635,"Genres":[{"Id":46,"Name":"Award Winning"},{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"},{"Id":42,"Name":"Seinen"},{"Id":37,"Name":"Supernatural"},{"Id":80,"Name":"Visual Arts"}],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2015,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":5400,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":721,"Completed":17965,"OnHold":318,"Dropped":209,"PlanToWatch":14459},"NumListUsers":33672},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-08T14:05:26.496+02:00"},{"Id":23989,"Title":"Maken-Ki!
