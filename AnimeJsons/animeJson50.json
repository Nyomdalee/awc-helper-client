A wedding is being held at Shibuya Hikarie, where Sato is dressed in a wedding dress. While Conan and the other invited guests are watching, an assailant suddenly bursts in, and Takagi, who was trying to protect Sato, is injured. Takagi survived and the situation was settled, but in Sato\u0027s eyes, the image of the grim reaper that she had seen when Jinpei Matsuda, the man she had been in love with, had been killed in a series of bombings three years ago, overlapped with Takagi\u0027s.\n\nAt the same time, the perpetrator of the bombings escapes from prison. Rei Furuya/Toru Amuro, a member of the public safety police, is hunting down the man who killed his classmate, but a mysterious person in disguise suddenly appears and puts a collar bomb on him.\n\nConan visits the underground shelter where Amuro is hiding out to disarm the collar bomb, and hears about an incident three years ago when he and his now deceased classmates from the police academy encountered an unidentified virtual bomber named \u0022Plamya\u0022 in Shibuya. As Conan and his team investigate, a disturbing shadow begins to loom over them.\n\n(Source: Detective Conan World)","Mean":8.05,"Rank":528,"Popularity":5507,"Genres":[{"Id":7,"Name":"Mystery"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":39,"Name":"Detective"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"}],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2022,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":6600,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":327,"Completed":7477,"OnHold":129,"Dropped":109,"PlanToWatch":5033,"Total":13075},"Favorites":94,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["TMS Entertainment"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":["\u0022Chronostasis (\u30AF\u30ED\u30CE\u30B9\u30BF\u30B7\u30B9)\u0022 by BUMP OF CHICKEN"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=17009","LastUpdated":"2023-08-30T18:54:32.559+02:00"},{"Id":49321,"Title":"Pokemon (2019): Natsuyasumi Chokuzen 1-jikan Special","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1977/122521.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2021,"Month":7,"Day":2,"Full":"2021-07-02"},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"2021-07-02"},"Synopsis":"Recap TV Special that aired after episode 72 of Pokemon (2019).","Mean":5.87,"Rank":9869,"Popularity":13242,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[{"Id":15,"Name":"Kids"}],"MediaType":"Special","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2021,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Game","AverageEpisodeDuration":2758,"Rating":"PG","Statistics":{"Watching":43,"Completed":482,"OnHold":20,"Dropped":61,"PlanToWatch":275,"Total":881},"Favorites":0,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["OLM"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2023-08-30T18:54:34.094+02:00"},{"Id":49326,"Title":"Ma-eum-uisoli","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1640/116194.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2016,"Month":7,"Day":19,"Full":"2016-07-19"},"EndDate":{"Year":2016,"Month":12,"Day":27,"Full":"2016-12-27"},"Synopsis":"While it may seem like a mere depiction of everyday life, The Sound of Your Heart is a comedy filled to the brim with wit, sarcasm, and parody.

When the young striker returns home, an invitation from the Japan Football Union awaits him. Through an arbitrary and biased decision-making process, Isagi is one of three hundred U-18 strikers selected for a controversial project named Blue Lock. \n\nThe project\u0027s ultimate goal is to turn one of the selected players into the star striker for the Japanese national team. To find the best participant, each diamond in the rough must compete against others through a series of solo and team competitions to rise to the top. Putting aside his ethical objections to the project, Isagi feels compelled to fight his way to the top, even if it means ruthlessly crushing the dreams of 299 aspiring young strikers.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":8.32,"Rank":233,"Popularity":348,"Genres":[{"Id":30,"Name":"Sports"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":77,"Name":"Team Sports"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":24,"StartSeason":{"Year":2022,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Sunday","StartTime":"01:30"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1490,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":165171,"Completed":277271,"OnHold":17099,"Dropped":17768,"PlanToWatch":111017,"Total":588326},"Favorites":10741,"Producers":["TV Asahi","Kodansha","Toy\u0027s Factory","Crunchyroll","Bandai Spirits","Bit grooove promotion","Bandai Namco Filmworks","Bandai Namco Music Live"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["8bit"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022\u30AB\u30AA\u30B9\u304C\u6975\u307E\u308B\u0022 by UNISON SQUARE GARDEN (eps 1-12)","\u0022Judgement\u0022 by ASH DA HERO (eps 13-)"],"Endings":["1: \u0022Chaos ga Kiwamaru (\u30AB\u30AA\u30B9\u304C\u6975\u307E\u308B)\u0022 by UNISON SQUARE GARDEN (eps 1,24)","2: \u0022WINNER\u0022 by Shuugo Nakamura (eps 2-12)","3: \u0022Judgement\u0022 by ASH DA HERO (eps 13)","4: \u0022Numbness like a ginger\u0022 by UNISON SQUARE GARDEN (eps 15-23)"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=16519","LastUpdated":"2023-08-30T18:56:37.007+02:00"},{"Id":49598,"Title":"Rich Keikan Cash!","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1513/117198.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2021,"Month":10,"Day":1,"Full":"2021-10-01"},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":null},"Synopsis":"The manga follows a police officer named Cash who solves any and all cases with the power of money.
