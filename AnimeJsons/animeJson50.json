Bitter, confused, and disappointed, Isagi wonders if the outcome would have been different had he not made the pass. When the young striker returns home, an invitation from the Japan Football Union awaits him. Through an arbitrary and biased decision-making process, Isagi is one of three hundred U-18 strikers selected for a controversial project named Blue Lock. \n\nThe project\u0027s ultimate goal is to turn one of the selected players into the star striker for the Japanese national team. To find the best participant, each diamond in the rough must compete against others through a series of solo and team competitions to rise to the top. Putting aside his ethical objections to the project, Isagi feels compelled to fight his way to the top, even if it means ruthlessly crushing the dreams of 299 aspiring young strikers.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":8.32,"Rank":235,"Popularity":354,"Genres":[{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"},{"Id":30,"Name":"Sports"},{"Id":77,"Name":"Team Sports"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":24,"StartSeason":{"Year":2022,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Sunday","StartTime":"01:30"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1490,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":167683,"Completed":267384,"OnHold":16614,"Dropped":17227,"PlanToWatch":110767},"NumListUsers":579675},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T18:35:46.224+02:00"},{"Id":49598,"Title":"Rich Keikan Cash!","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1513/117198.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1513/117198l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Oct 01 2021","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2021,"Month":10,"Day":1},"EndDate":null,"DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null},"Synopsis":"The manga follows a police officer named Cash who solves any and all cases with the power of money.

While their stories are utterly different, there is one common thread: betrayal. Each of the four, having been bitterly betrayed by someone they treasured, has developed a deep-seated distrust of humanity.\n\nBut in addition to their similar worldviews, the four have one more commonality: a critical lack of funds.
