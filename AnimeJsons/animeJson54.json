Left without a family, all he has to his name is the ship and submarine left to him by his oceanologist grandmother, and her debts.\n\nHis only hope to restore the dreams for the future that he has lost is to take up an opportunity presented to him by the suspicious debt collector Catherine.

We might have a chance to see them if we could prevent the further environmental pollution and make it easier for the other creatures to live.\n\n(Source: ASIFA-Japan)","Mean":null,"Rank":15808,"Popularity":21628,"Genres":[{"Id":46,"Name":"Award Winning"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":null,"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":780,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Watching":3,"Completed":25,"OnHold":3,"Dropped":19,"PlanToWatch":29,"Total":79},"Favorites":0,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":[],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=11094","LastUpdated":"2023-09-08T22:18:03.2900833Z"},{"Id":53213,"Title":"Revenger","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1884/131748.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2023,"Month":1,"Day":5,"Full":"2023-01-05"},"EndDate":{"Year":2023,"Month":3,"Day":23,"Full":"2023-03-23"},"Synopsis":"Tricked into assassinating his own prospective father-in-law, righteous samurai Raizou Kurima is overwhelmed with guilt. In order to reclaim his honor, Raizou swears vengeance on the lord who gave him those misleading orders. In his pursuit, he is aided by self-proclaimed merchant-of-all-trades Yuuen Usui, who is actually one of the Revengers\u2014assassins who seek justice for the wronged and dispense bloody revenge on their behalf.\n\nTragedy seems destined to follow Raizou as he becomes increasingly intertwined with members of the Revengers. As he begins working as a vigilante alongside them, the complicated web between the corrupt Japanese political elite, the unscrupulous Europeans, and the Revengers gradually reveals itself.

Thinking that he couldn\u0027t just leave it, he took it home and raised it until his age approached forty.\n\nHis now grown-up daughter had also wanted to become an adventurer, likely from growing up watching her father. Although her father had taught her the sword since she was young for self-defense, her talent at it was quite impressive. Thinking that it would be better for her not to be stuck out in the country for the rest of her life, our protagonist sent her to the adventurer\u0027s guild in the Capital.\n\nAfter another five years, the protagonist now in his forties is still acting as a pseudo-adventurer in the countryside, however, his daughter\u2014now a distinguished S-Class adventurer\u2014hasn\u0027t returned home even once yet...\n\n(Source: MU,
