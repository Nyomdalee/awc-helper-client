But when Katsura, the leader of the Joui rebels and Gintoki\u0027s long-time acquaintance, disappears after being brutally attacked by an unknown assassin, Shinpachi and Kagura begin an investigation into his whereabouts and the identity of the assailant. Meanwhile, Gintoki takes on a seemingly unrelated job: the blacksmith Tetsuya requests that Gin recover a strange and powerful sword called the Benizakura which was recently stolen.\n\nAs the two investigations gradually intersect, the Yorozuya crew find themselves in the midst of a major conspiracy that hinges on the sinister nature of the Benizakura sword. Gintoki resolves to take the fight directly to the enemy headquarters, and together with a few unexpected allies, sets out on one of his most perilous jobs yet.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":8.52,"Rank":119,"Popularity":1394,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"},{"Id":20,"Name":"Parody"},{"Id":21,"Name":"Samurai"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"},{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"}],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2010,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":5700,"Rating":"R","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":2661,"Completed":121049,"OnHold":1133,"Dropped":862,"PlanToWatch":32936},"NumListUsers":158641},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T21:59:30.83+02:00"},{"Id":7473,"Title":"Rennyo to Sono Haha","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/17899.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/17899l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Oct 07 1981","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":1981,"Month":10,"Day":7},"EndDate":"Oct 07 1981","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":1981,"Month":10,"Day":7},"Synopsis":"Rennyo was the key figure responsible for the restoration of Shin Buddhism in Japan, in particular the Honganji lineage, during a slump in its fortunes during the Middle Ages.
