Unfortunately, half-human criminals means non-human clues that often leave the police stumped. That\u0027s where lone wolf detectives like Hiroshi Inaba come in. He\u0027s literally part wolf and has the amazing ability to extract critical information just by examining or tasting a sample of someone\u0027s hair! Of course, that ability has also resulted in Inaba having a little bit of a hair fetish, but that doesn\u0027t seem to be a problem for his two assistants. (Well, at least the cross-dressing one isn\u0027t complaining much.) And it\u0027s nothing compared to the strange tastes of Inaba\u0027s nemesis, the omnivorous (and half goat) crime boss Don Valentino, who has an appetite for green legal tender instead of tender young greens! Inaba\u0027s sworn to cut Valentino out of the criminal flock before the Don can wolf down more ill-gotten dough, but he\u0027s going to have to chew his way through a lot of evidence to get his goat. Can sheer dogged detective work put the baaaaad guys behind bars?\n\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)","Mean":7.25,"Rank":2867,"Popularity":1926,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":39,"Name":"Detective"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"},{"Id":57,"Name":"Gag Humor"},{"Id":7,"Name":"Mystery"},{"Id":68,"Name":"Organized Crime"},{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2013,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Friday","StartTime":"23:30"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1420,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":6693,"Completed":45585,"OnHold":4156,"Dropped":7393,"PlanToWatch":38856},"NumListUsers":102683},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-07T21:11:49.687"},{"Id":15111,"Title":"Spy Penguin","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/40957.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/40957l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Sep 04 2012","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2012,"Month":9,"Day":4},"EndDate":"Nov 04 2012","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2012,"Month":11,"Day":4},"Synopsis":"Spy Penguin revolves around a group of three penguins who protect Paris from those who threaten the peace.\n\n(Source: ANN)","Mean":null,"Rank":20256,"Popularity":17380,"Genres":[{"Id":15,"Name":"Kids"}],"MediaType":"OVA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":5,"StartSeason":{"Year":2012,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":240,"Rating":"PG","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":24,"Completed":79,"OnHold":13,"Dropped":64,"PlanToWatch":125},"NumListUsers":305},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-07T21:11:51.451"},{"Id":15117,"Title":"Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai: Tenri-hen","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/43359.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/43359l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Oct 18 2012","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2012,"Month":10,"Day":18},"EndDate":"Dec 18 2012","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2012,"Month":12,"Day":18},"Synopsis":"It is summer break and Keima intends to spend all his time on video games.
