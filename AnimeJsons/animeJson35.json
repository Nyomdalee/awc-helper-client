For Yajirou, it is restoring his former shapeshifting abilities, whilst little Yashirou is content with continuing his work at the family\u2019s factory. But for the third son, Yasaburou, it simply means embracing the \u0022fool\u0027s blood\u0022 he inherited from his father and living a carefree but interesting life. This, of course, includes hunting for the mysterious and elusive snake-like creature known as a tsuchinoko, and causing ripples of trouble at every turn.\n\nHowever, these ripples threaten to turn into waves with the return of Nidaime, the estranged son of the brothers\u0027 tengu teacher, Professor Akadama. Nidaime bears a grudge against not only his father, but his father\u0027s apprentice Benten as well. His loyalties suddenly brought into question, Yasaburou must use his tanuki wit to appease all sides without getting caught in the crossfire, before the delicate balance between human, tengu, and tanuki is overthrown and all hell breaks loose.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":8.09,"Rank":483,"Popularity":2617,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"},{"Id":36,"Name":"Slice of Life"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":6,"Name":"Mythology"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2017,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Sunday","StartTime":"22:00"},"Source":"Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":1420,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":3588,"Completed":31570,"OnHold":1742,"Dropped":1143,"PlanToWatch":24883,"Total":62926},"Favorites":305,"Producers":["Lantis","Good Smile Company","Docomo Anime Store","Yomiuri TV Enterprise","DMM.com","Cygames"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["P.A.

Curiosity gets the better of her and she follows it into nearby woods.

Due to allegedly attracting merfolk and subsequently causing the death of the elder\u0027s mother, music is seldom discussed in the Ashimoto household. Even so, Kai finds solace in making looped beats on his laptop and uploading them to the internet.\n\nDespite his reserved and glum demeanor, Kai is approached by Kunio and Yuuho Ebina, two cheerful classmates that happened upon one of his videos. The pair ask him to join their rock band but are met with apathy. Nevertheless, Kai agrees to accompany them in a practice session on Merfolk Island, where he soon witnesses something that he cannot explain.\n\nLater that night, Kai is composing music in his room when he attracts a familiar entity\u2014a mermaid. As she twirls and grins to the sound of his stereo, Kai discovers a number of aspects about the being who introduces herself as Lu: she possesses incredible water manipulation powers; she buds a pair of functioning legs with the sound of music; but most notably, she is a truly benevolent creature who simply wants people to like her.
