He says that mushrooms are appearing on tossed away items that as they are born from the feelings of sadness, and they emit a negative energy that effects both humans and Cocotama. Cocotama can get rid of them but not without the acorn and not at the speed humans are currently discarding items at.\n\nTepple uses the acorn to take a Happy Star but inadvertently causes a rift of darkness and an infestation of mushrooms in Cocotama World. And Happy Stars begin spilling out into the human world draining all magic out. Kokoro and the Cocotama must heal Tepple\u0027s heart before the darkness consumes the human world.","Mean":6.44,"Rank":6970,"Popularity":14278,"Genres":[{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"},{"Id":15,"Name":"Kids"}],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2017,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":4574,"Rating":"PG","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":30,"Completed":223,"OnHold":26,"Dropped":87,"PlanToWatch":266},"NumListUsers":632},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T13:31:38.743+02:00"},{"Id":34201,"Title":"Kuni-chan no Ikka Ranran","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/82286.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/82286l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Sep 23 1994","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":1994,"Month":9,"Day":23},"EndDate":"Sep 23 1994","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":1994,"Month":9,"Day":23},"Synopsis":"","Mean":null,"Rank":15073,"Popularity":18585,"Genres":[{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":36,"Name":"Slice of Life"}],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":1994,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Other","AverageEpisodeDuration":1200,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":20,"Completed":58,"OnHold":4,"Dropped":58,"PlanToWatch":90},"NumListUsers":230},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T13:31:42.1+02:00"},{"Id":34204,"Title":"Hibike!

From within that energy appeared the Demon Lord of Diabolos, an evil being who instantly murdered the archdukes of both factions, shattering any hope for peace between them.\n \nHaving failed to prevent this disaster, Siluca Meletes, an Alliance mage, is traveling through the Chaos-infested countryside to study under a master magician. When she is intercepted by a group of soldiers working with the Federation, Siluca is rescued by Theo Cornaro, a young warrior carrying a mysterious \u0022Crest,\u0022 a magical symbol that gives its wielder the ability to banish Chaos. Bearing no allegiance to a specific domain, Theo hopes to attain the rank of Lord so that he can liberate his home town of Sistina from its tyrannical ruler and the Chaos spreading within it. Impressed by his noble goal, Siluca enters into a magical contract with Theo, and the two embark on a journey to restore balance to their war-torn land.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n","Mean":7.22,"Rank":3015,"Popularity":758,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":24,"StartSeason":{"Year":2018,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Saturday","StartTime":"00:00"},"Source":"Light Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":1420,"Rating":"R","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":32355,"Completed":150740,"OnHold":12522,"Dropped":24287,"PlanToWatch":79277},"NumListUsers":299181},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T13:33:01.303+02:00"},{"Id":34280,"Title":"Gamers!","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/86828.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/86828l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Jul 13 2017","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2017,"Month":7,"Day":13},"EndDate":"Sep 28 2017","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2017,"Month":9,"Day":28},"Synopsis":"Keita Amano is a typical high school gamer living out an average student\u0027s life.

Though Yuzu initially tries to be friendly with her, Mei\u0027s cold shoulder routine forces Yuzu to begin teasing her. But before Yuzu can finish her sentence, Mei forces her to the ground and kisses her, with Yuzu desperately trying to break free.

Due to allegedly attracting merfolk and subsequently causing the death of the elder\u0027s mother, music is seldom discussed in the Ashimoto household. Even so, Kai finds solace in making looped beats on his laptop and uploading them to the internet.\n\nDespite his reserved and glum demeanor, Kai is approached by Kunio and Yuuho Ebina, two cheerful classmates that happened upon one of his videos. The pair ask him to join their rock band but are met with apathy. Nevertheless, Kai agrees to accompany them in a practice session on Merfolk Island, where he soon witnesses something that he cannot explain.\n\nLater that night, Kai is composing music in his room when he attracts a familiar entity\u2014a mermaid. As she twirls and grins to the sound of his stereo, Kai discovers a number of aspects about the being who introduces herself as Lu: she possesses incredible water manipulation powers; she buds a pair of functioning legs with the sound of music; but most notably, she is a truly benevolent creature who simply wants people to like her. Fostering a dynamic friendship, Kai and Lu gradually come to express their genuine selves, testing the long-standing boundaries that have deafened the resounding harmony among the people of Hinashi Town.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n","Mean":7.39,"Rank":2163,"Popularity":2911,"Genres":[{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":46,"Name":"Award Winning"},{"Id":19,"Name":"Music"},{"Id":37,"Name":"Supernatural"}],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2017,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":6707,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":1524,"Completed":23385,"OnHold":590,"Dropped":319,"PlanToWatch":25560},"NumListUsers":51378},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T13:41:44.903+02:00"},{"Id":34794,"Title":"Yukai na Animal Bus","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1863/133827.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1863/133827l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Jan 08 2017","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2017,"Month":1,"Day":8},"EndDate":"Mar 26 2017","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2017,"Month":3,"Day":26},"Synopsis":" ","Mean":null,"Rank":14437,"Popularity":17153,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":15,"Name":"Kids"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2017,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":80,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":17,"Completed":97,"OnHold":8,"Dropped":96,"PlanToWatch":106},"NumListUsers":324},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T13:41:46.637+02:00"},{"Id":34795,"Title":"Tamashii Insert","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/89399.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/89399l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Jul 07 2017","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2017,"Month":7,"Day":7},"EndDate":"Oct 06 2017","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2017,"Month":10,"Day":6},"Synopsis":"Half a year after Naoto Takahashi\u0027s father got remarried, he hasn\u0027t gotten used to the new family members: his stepmother, Sachiko, and his new little sister, Yui.
