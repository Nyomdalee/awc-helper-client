In response to their arrival, an organization called the Border Defense Agency has been established to combat the Neighbor menace through special weapons called \u0022Triggers.\u0022 Even though several years have passed after the gate first opened, Neighbors are still a threat and members of Border remain on guard to ensure the safety of the planet.\n\nDespite this delicate situation, members-in-training, such as Osamu Mikumo, are not permitted to use their Triggers outside of headquarters. But when the mysterious new student in his class is dragged into a forbidden area by bullies, they are attacked by Neighbors, and Osamu has no choice but to do what he believes is right. Much to his surprise, however, the transfer student Yuuma Kuga makes short work of the aliens, revealing that he is a humanoid Neighbor in disguise.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.58,"Rank":1458,"Popularity":535,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":73,"StartSeason":{"Year":2014,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Sunday","StartTime":"06:30"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1395,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":53384,"Completed":149622,"OnHold":27958,"Dropped":34152,"PlanToWatch":140567,"Total":405683},"Favorites":2735,"Producers":["TV Asahi"],"Licensors":["Sentai Filmworks"],"Studios":["Toei Animation"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["1: \u0022GIRIGIRI\u0022 by Sonar Pocket (eps 1-23)","2: \u0022Ashita no Hikari (\u30A2\u30B7\u30BF\u30CE\u30D2\u30AB\u30EA)\u0022 by AAA (eps 27-47)","3: \u0022Dream Trigger (\u30C9\u30EA\u30FC\u30E0\u30C8\u30EA\u30AC\u30FC)\u0022 by Pile (eps 49-72)"],"Endings":["1: \u0022Ashita no Hikari (\u30A2\u30B7\u30BF\u30CE\u30D2\u30AB\u30EA)\u0022 by AAA (eps 24-26)","2: \u0022Dream Trigger (\u30C9\u30EA\u30FC\u30E0\u30C8\u30EA\u30AC\u30FC)\u0022 by Pile (eps 48, 73)"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=10657","LastUpdated":"2023-09-08T22:18:02.8423656Z"},{"Id":24415,"Title":"Kuroko no Basket 3rd Season","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/68299.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2015,"Month":1,"Day":11,"Full":"2015-01-11"},"EndDate":{"Year":2015,"Month":6,"Day":30,"Full":"2015-06-30"},"Synopsis":"Seirin prepares to face major obstacles on their path to winning the Winter Cup, including the teams each possessing a member of the Generation of Miracles.

The Mushishi Ginko is given a job request from Tanyuu Karibusa: oversee the work of the head of the Minai clan, Kumado Minai, in investigating an abandoned village where dead wood and even houses spring back to life as flourishing plants.\n\nThough the Minai clan are oddly ruthless among Mushishi, even more peculiar is their widespread dull character, with little appreciation for beauty or sentiment. Tanyuu believes there is more to this trend than meets the eye. Ginko aims to answer her curiosity as he follows Kumado into a \u0022Path of Thorns,\u0022 a place where Mushi flow from their own strange sources into the world of the living.

The travelling Mushishi, Ginko, persists in trying to set right the strange and unsettling situations he encounters.

But the lines that he seeks to draw are subjective. Some of his patients would rather exercise their new powers until they are utterly consumed by them; others desperately strive to rid themselves of afflictions which are in fact protecting their lives from devastation. Those who cross paths with Mushi must learn to accept seemingly impossible consequences for their actions, and heal wounds they did not know they had. Otherwise, they risk meeting with fates beyond their comprehension.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":8.73,"Rank":47,"Popularity":889,"Genres":[{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":7,"Name":"Mystery"},{"Id":36,"Name":"Slice of Life"},{"Id":37,"Name":"Supernatural"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":50,"Name":"Adult Cast"},{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"},{"Id":63,"Name":"Iyashikei"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":42,"Name":"Seinen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":10,"StartSeason":{"Year":2014,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Sunday","StartTime":"00:30"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1430,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":13730,"Completed":128755,"OnHold":6360,"Dropped":3183,"PlanToWatch":105487,"Total":257515},"Favorites":1416,"Producers":["Aniplex","Kodansha","Delfi Sound"],"Licensors":["Aniplex of America"],"Studios":["Artland"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022SHIVER\u0022 by Lucy Rose"],"Endings":["1: \u0022Kusa no Shitone (\u8349\u306E\u8335)\u0022 by Toshio Masuda (eps 1)","2: \u0022Kaoru Yami (\u9999\u308B\u95C7)\u0022 by Toshio Masuda (eps 2)","3: \u0022Nokori Beni (\u6B8B\u308A\u7D05)\u0022 by Toshio Masuda (eps 3)","4: \u0022Komori E (\u96A0\u308A\u6C5F)\u0022 by Toshio Masuda (eps 4)","5: \u0022Hikari no Ou (\u5149\u306E\u7DD2)\u0022 by Toshio Masuda (eps 5)","6: \u0022Koten no Hoshi (\u58FA\u5929\u306E\u661F)\u0022 by Toshio Masuda (eps 6)","7: \u0022Mizu Aomu (\u6C34\u78A7\u3080)\u0022 by Toshio Masuda (eps 7)","8: \u0022Ikatsuchi no Tamoto (\u96F7\u306E\u8882)\u0022 by Toshio Masuda (eps 8)","9: \u0022Doro no Kusa (\u6CE5\u306E\u8349)\u0022 by Toshio Masuda (eps 9)","10: \u0022Tokoshie no Ki (\u5E38\u306E\u6A39)\u0022 by Toshio Masuda (eps 10)"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=10571","LastUpdated":"2023-09-08T22:18:02.8434364Z"},{"Id":24703,"Title":"High School DxD BorN","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/73642.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2015,"Month":4,"Day":4,"Full":"2015-04-04"},"EndDate":{"Year":2015,"Month":6,"Day":20,"Full":"2015-06-20"},"Synopsis":"The Red Dragon Emperor, Issei Hyoudou, and the Occult Research Club are back in action as summer break comes for the students of Kuoh Academy.
