However, his cover is blown, and the spy reveals himself to be an alien in disguise. Amidst the ensuing chaos, Jirou enlists the aid of cafe waitress and magical girl Kikko Hoshino, one of many \u0022superhumans\u0022 who blend into society and secretly protect humanity from extraterrestrial threats. As a member of the government agency known as the Super Population Research Laboratory, Jirou has the dual task of protecting superhumans that defend humanity and disposing of any deemed too dangerous to live. Having proven herself a worthy ally, Kikko is invited to join the agency as its newest recruit.\n\nFast forward five years: disapproval and distaste for superhumans are now commonplace in Tokyo. From government corruption and conflicting ideas of justice, to the morality of superhuman rights, the relationship between humans and the supernatural minority balances precariously in a world pervaded by whispers of unrest and unease. Under mysterious circumstances, Jirou has betrayed the agency, and is now a fugitive on the run.

when they hold the ball. The rules are simple: one player has to carry the ball past the goalposts across the field while avoiding the other team, who are allowed to use all their force to knock the enemy down. However, the player can pass to a teammate behind them or kick the ball before they are tackled. Unlike other sports, the game continues even when the person holding the ball is taken down.\n\nKenji Gion is a short but feisty high school freshman at Kanagawa High School. Right after the school\u0027s opening ceremony, he meets the tall and timid Sumiaki Iwashimizu, and the two of them get an invitation to observe the rugby club. \n\nWhen Gion watches the match, he realizes that even though big and tall guys have an advantage, there are positions for people of all shapes and sizes. Immediately convinced that he has found a sport he can excel at despite his short stature, he signs up, though Iwashimizu declines. Gion is unable to accept Iwashimizu\u0027s excuses and drags him back into the sport. Their training becomes intense as they aim to become the champions of Hanazono, the national high school rugby championships.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.04,"Rank":3901,"Popularity":1855,"Genres":[{"Id":23,"Name":"School"},{"Id":42,"Name":"Seinen"},{"Id":30,"Name":"Sports"},{"Id":77,"Name":"Team Sports"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":25,"StartSeason":{"Year":2016,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Friday","StartTime":"00:00"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1440,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":10613,"Completed":56870,"OnHold":5579,"Dropped":11424,"PlanToWatch":24826},"NumListUsers":109312},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T01:18:55.301"},{"Id":31592,"Title":"Pokemon XY\u0026Z","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1599/94412.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1599/94412l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Oct 29 2015","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2015,"Month":10,"Day":29},"EndDate":"Oct 27 2016","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2016,"Month":10,"Day":27},"Synopsis":"The journey of Satoshi and his friends through the Kalos region continues!

When they meet, Joutarou realizes that he may have more in common with Jousuke than just a blood relation.\n\nAlong with the mild-mannered Kouichi Hirose and the boisterous Okuyasu Nijimura, the group dedicates themselves to investigating recent disappearances and other suspicious occurrences within Morioh. Aided by the power of Stands, the four men will encounter danger at every street corner, as it is up to them to unravel the town\u0027s secrets, before another occurs.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":8.5,"Rank":129,"Popularity":131,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"},{"Id":37,"Name":"Supernatural"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":39,"StartSeason":{"Year":2016,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Saturday","StartTime":"00:30"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1422,"Rating":"R","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":59642,"Completed":887789,"OnHold":16810,"Dropped":9891,"PlanToWatch":95450},"NumListUsers":1069582},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T01:24:47.195"},{"Id":31941,"Title":"Alice in Dreamland","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1054/132914.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1054/132914l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Dec 19 2015","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2015,"Month":12,"Day":19},"EndDate":"Dec 19 2015","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2015,"Month":12,"Day":19},"Synopsis":"Alice is summoned by the White Rabbit to save Wonderland from spreading Darkness.

Kumiko finds the motivation she needs to make music once more with the help of her bandmates, some of whom are new like novice tubist Hazuki Katou; veteran contrabassist Sapphire Kawashima; and band vice president and fellow euphonist Asuka Tanaka. Others are old friends, like Kumiko\u0027s childhood friend and hornist-turned-trombonist Shuuichi Tsukamoto, and trumpeter and bandmate from middle school, Reina Kousaka.\n\nHowever, in the band itself, chaos reigns supreme. Despite their intention to qualify for the national band competition, as they currently are, just competing in the local festival will be a challenge\u2014unless the new band advisor Noboru Taki does something about it.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.56,"Rank":1555,"Popularity":3944,"Genres":[{"Id":19,"Name":"Music"},{"Id":70,"Name":"Performing Arts"},{"Id":23,"Name":"School"}],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2016,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":6180,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":803,"Completed":13869,"OnHold":436,"Dropped":346,"PlanToWatch":13190},"NumListUsers":28644},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T01:25:44.311"},{"Id":31994,"Title":"Yami Shibai 3","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/78074.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/78074l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Jan 11 2016","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2016,"Month":1,"Day":11},"EndDate":"Apr 04 2016","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2016,"Month":4,"Day":4},"Synopsis":"A young boy silently sketches out the forms of the horrors that dwell in his mind.
