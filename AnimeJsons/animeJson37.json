After multiple attempts to retrieve the cookie fail, Hamtarou suggests that he be lowered down into the vase, like a prize-catching crane machine. With this plan, Hamtarou is able to retrieve Bijou\u0027s biscuit. The vase wobbles and he begins to fall, but the dog wakes up and rescues the hamster by catching him with a pillow. With Hamtarou saved, Bijou hugs Hamtarou graciously and the episode ends as Hamtarou watches the dog slip away to go back to sleep.\n\nI Love You, Natsumi-chan (\u30C9\u30E9\u30DE ~ \u5927\u597D\u304D\u3001\u306A\u3064\u307F\u3061\u3083\u3093): The episode opens with Hamtarou having a bit of a manly montage; he seems like he has something important to do. Before she leaves for school, Natsumi tells Hamtarou she likes him while petting him. In response, without her understanding, Hamtarou confesses to Natsumi that he loves her romantically, but knows that Natsumi only loves him as a companion.

Seeking to defend democracy and restore the Alliance constitution, Admiral Yang Wen-li faces off against his fellow citizens\u2014and, regrettably, the father of his devoted adjutant Lieutenant Frederica Greenhill.\n\nNow with the Free Planets Alliance thoroughly occupied with their own internal matters, the forces of the Galactic Empire can safely suppress the newly formed Lippstadt League led by Duke Otto von Braunschweig. However, with his friend and loyal subordinate High Admiral Siegfried Kircheis fighting far away in the noble-controlled frontier regions, Reinhard increasingly relies on the advice of the ruthless Vice Admiral Paul von Oberstein, whose influence within the esteemed Lohengramm admiralty steadily grows.\n\nThough bloodshed is inevitable on both sides of the galaxy, Yang Wen-li of the Alliance and Reinhard von Lohengramm of the Empire each ask themselves the same questions: how will history look back on their actions?

However, this all changes when the Megalo Box champion Yuuri enters his shabby ring under the guise of just another challenger. Taken out in a single round, Junk Dog is left with a challenge: \u0022If you\u0027re serious about fighting me again, then fight your way up to me and my ring.\u0022\n\nFilled with overwhelming excitement and backed by the criminal syndicate responsible for his thrown matches, Junk Dog enters Megalonia: a world-spanning tournament that will decide the strongest Megalo Boxer of them all.

A select few among mankind took to the stars in a spacefaring vessel called the Aratrum in search of \u0022the promised land,\u0022 the planet Tau-e that could sustain human life. But the migration plan fails, and the remnants of the human race decide to return to Earth. But the distortions in space-time and the distance traveled means that mankind is returning to a completely changed Earth some 20,000 years later. The returnees, led by hero Haruo, prepare to take the fight to Godzilla based on a strategy that has been 20 years in the making. Carried out with the help of two alien species, the Exif and the Bilusaludo, the humans succeed in defeating Godzilla in a costly battle to the death.\n\nBut the victory is short-lived. Rising from the depths of the planet is a new breed of monster, dubbed \u0022Godzilla Earth.\u0022 Evolving for 20,000 years, the creature stands 300 meters high, weighs over 100,000 tons and wields such overwhelmingly destructive power that Haruo and company have no choice but to run for their lives.\n\nComing to Haruo\u0027s rescue, however, is Miana, a member of an aboriginal tribe called the Houtua. They are the first humanoid people the returnees have encountered. Could they descend from humans? \u0022Our tribal god was destroyed by Godzilla. All that we have left are these eggs. Anyone who has tried to fight or resist him has been drowned in fire,\u0022 the tribespeople say to Haruo, who responds with: \u0022This is our last hope of recovering our home.\u0022\n\nMeanwhile, Bilusaludo commander, Galu-gu is elated to discover that the Houtua tribe\u0027s arrowheads are made of a nanometal or a self-sustaining metal. It had been developed in the 21st century as an \u0022anti-Godzilla\u0022 killer weapon deployed at their decisive battle fought at the foot of Mt. Fuji, but had been destroyed before it could be activated in the form of a \u0022Mecha-Godzilla.\u0022 The nanometal was its base substance, and proof that the manufacturing plant can still be used.\n\n(Source: Official site)","Mean":6.54,"Rank":6403,"Popularity":3378,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"}],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2018,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":6010,"Rating":"R","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":541,"Completed":30769,"OnHold":228,"Dropped":257,"PlanToWatch":7456},"NumListUsers":39251},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T14:16:09.389+02:00"},{"Id":36817,"Title":"Sunohara-sou no Kanrinin-san","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1539/124746.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1539/124746l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Jul 05 2018","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2018,"Month":7,"Day":5},"EndDate":"Sep 20 2018","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2018,"Month":9,"Day":20},"Synopsis":"Shiina Aki is constantly being treated like a girl due to his feminine looks so he decides to move to Tokyo to attend middle school in an attempt to change himself.\n\nHowever, what awaits him in his new home, Sunohara-sou, is the kind-hearted caretaker, Sunohara Ayaka.

Out of desperation she turns to the message board Free Friends to earn some money. She develops a relationship with her first partner, Kaito, without realizing that they\u0027re much more than strangers...\n\nKaito, the newest student teacher at Minatohashi Higashi Academy, has a vice. Unable and unwilling to form meaningful, intimate relationships with other people, he instead satiates his need for intimacy through compensated dating. In order to feed this habit, he uses a message board known as Free Friends. Through its services, he can make the necessary arrangements and appointments with the various girls who also use the site, mainly students running away from home or simply in need of extra income.\n\nHis troubles trace back to a deeply seated complex: a hollow, yearning feeling brought on by the thought and sight of violets. Violets, or \u0022Sumire\u0022, remind him of the sister he\u0027d been separated from during their childhood when their parents had divorced. Only by losing himself in a woman\u0027s body can he rid himself of those clinging, nostalgic feelings.\n\nRight before the school year begins, the mere reminder of the academy\u0027s famed violet flowerbeds (despite them not even being in bloom at the time) is enough to drive Kaito to Free Friends. A seemingly routine exchange leaves him completely unprepared for the girl waiting for him: an absolutely stunning beauty by the pseudonym of \u0022Sumi\u0022.\n\nA few days later, he discovers that \u0022Sumi\u0022 is not only a student at the exact same school he teaches at, but that her classmates call her \u0022Sumire\u0022. Incredulous, Kaito checks the school rosters. Surely it\u0027s not the same Sumire he knows; surely it\u0027s just another girl with the same given name? But as if setting him up for the universe\u0027s biggest punchline, the only Sumire at the school is none other than his very own Shinozaki Sumire, the sister his mother had taken away from him. Kaito\u0027s dreams of one day reuniting with his sister have in fact already been realized... just not in a way that he ever could have imagined.\n\n(Source: VNDB)","Mean":6.53,"Rank":null,"Popularity":7597,"Genres":[{"Id":12,"Name":"Hentai"}],"MediaType":"OVA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":4,"StartSeason":{"Year":2018,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Visual Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":1440,"Rating":"Rx","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":951,"Completed":2376,"OnHold":418,"Dropped":327,"PlanToWatch":1741},"NumListUsers":5813},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T14:17:10.549+02:00"},{"Id":36881,"Title":"Dennou Senshi Dokan-kun","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1091/105649.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1091/105649l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Jan 15 2007","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2007,"Month":1,"Day":15},"EndDate":"Mar 26 2007","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2007,"Month":3,"Day":26},"Synopsis":"An animated series that aired within the variety program \u0022Fight Tension\u2606Depart.\u0022","Mean":null,"Rank":18668,"Popularity":18082,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":11,"StartSeason":{"Year":2007,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Unknown","AverageEpisodeDuration":360,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":16,"Completed":93,"OnHold":6,"Dropped":63,"PlanToWatch":81},"NumListUsers":259},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T14:17:15.678+02:00"},{"Id":36882,"Title":"Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1776/97682.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1776/97682l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Jul 08 2019","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2019,"Month":7,"Day":8},"EndDate":"Oct 07 2019","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2019,"Month":10,"Day":7},"Synopsis":"The ordinary life of 17-year-old otaku Hajime Nagumo is disrupted when he and his classmates are summoned to a fantasy world and tasked with saving mankind.
