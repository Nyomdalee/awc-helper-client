Having played the role of king in the coalition battle, Zheng has the trust of the people\u2014but L\u00FC is far from out of the fight. In 18 months, he plans to interrupt Zheng\u0027s coming-of-age ceremony.\n\nMeanwhile, a Zhao army numbering 20,000 troops has set out toward Qin. In the royal court, due to the lack of generals capable of responding to the incoming threat, L\u00FC slyly suggests that Zheng take command. However, Cheng Jiao, Zheng\u0027s half-brother, volunteers instead. As they grew to trust each other during the coalition battle, Zheng now accepts Jiao as his replacement.\n\nHowever, the Zhao forces retreat a mere half-day after clashing with Jiao\u0027s army. With trouble quickly brewing in the shadows, the internal struggle of Qin is only complicated further.
