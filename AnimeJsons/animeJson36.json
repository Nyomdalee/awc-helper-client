The heroes of Zhou and some of their fallen enemies from Shang are eventually endowed with heavenly ranking and essentially elevated to their roles as gods, hence the title of the novel.\n\n(Source: Wiki)","Mean":4.98,"Rank":12336,"Popularity":15551,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"},{"Id":17,"Name":"Martial Arts"}],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":1976,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":5453,"Rating":"PG","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":30,"Completed":199,"OnHold":9,"Dropped":79,"PlanToWatch":137},"NumListUsers":454},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T13:51:43.625+02:00"},{"Id":35382,"Title":"Yuri!!! on Ice: Yuri Plisetsky GPF in Barcelona EX - Welcome to The Madness","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/85548.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/85548l.jpg"},"StartDate":"May 26 2017","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2017,"Month":5,"Day":26},"EndDate":"May 26 2017","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2017,"Month":5,"Day":26},"Synopsis":"In his exhibition performance for the Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final in Barcelona, 15-year-old Yuri Plisetsky seeks to defy his \u0022Russian Fairy\u0022 nickname by showing off wild new choreography, the likes of which have never been seen from him on the ice before.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.97,"Rank":645,"Popularity":2242,"Genres":[{"Id":19,"Name":"Music"},{"Id":30,"Name":"Sports"}],"MediaType":"Special","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2017,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":152,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":1486,"Completed":55055,"OnHold":573,"Dropped":640,"PlanToWatch":23296},"NumListUsers":81050},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T13:51:46.42+02:00"},{"Id":35383,"Title":"Yousei Land Mukashibanashi","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/85594.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/85594l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Apr 10 2017","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2017,"Month":4,"Day":10},"EndDate":"Jun 26 2017","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2017,"Month":6,"Day":26},"Synopsis":"A direct sequel to Forest Fairy Five.","Mean":4.65,"Rank":12666,"Popularity":13141,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"},{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2017,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Monday","StartTime":"20:00"},"Source":"Picture Book","AverageEpisodeDuration":600,"Rating":"PG","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":56,"Completed":413,"OnHold":26,"Dropped":131,"PlanToWatch":266},"NumListUsers":892},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T13:51:47.408+02:00"},{"Id":35385,"Title":"Yukai na Animal Bus 2nd Season","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/85231.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/85231l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Jul 02 2017","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2017,"Month":7,"Day":2},"EndDate":"Sep 17 2017","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2017,"Month":9,"Day":17},"Synopsis":"Second season of Yukai na Animal Bus.","Mean":null,"Rank":14438,"Popularity":18046,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":15,"Name":"Kids"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2017,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":80,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":16,"Completed":90,"OnHold":9,"Dropped":78,"PlanToWatch":69},"NumListUsers":262},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T13:51:49.753+02:00"},{"Id":35386,"Title":"Tonpei to Sarukichi","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/85236.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/85236l.jpg"},"StartDate":"1932","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":1932,"Month":null,"Day":null},"EndDate":"1932","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":1932,"Month":null,"Day":null},"Synopsis":"A lazy pig Tonpei steals food from the monkeys Sarukichi and assaults some of them.

They already have what is left of the giant dragons, the Renato, under their control, and now their king wishes to add the immortality of the Iorph to his bloodline.\n\nThe humans and their Renato ravage the Iorph homeland and kill most of its inhabitants. Caught in the midst of the attack, Maquia is carried off by one of the Renato that has gone berserk. It soon dies, and she is left deserted in a forest far from home, now truly alone save for the cries of a single baby off in the distance. Maquia finds the baby in a destroyed village and decides to raise him as her own, naming him Ariel. Although she knows nothing of the human world, how to raise a child that ages much faster than her, or how to live with the smoldering loneliness inside, she is determined to make it all work somehow.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":8.4,"Rank":178,"Popularity":526,"Genres":[{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"}],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2018,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":6874,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":14548,"Completed":216486,"OnHold":4066,"Dropped":1499,"PlanToWatch":172192},"NumListUsers":408791},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T13:59:44.766+02:00"},{"Id":35853,"Title":"Zero Seiki Movie 1: Emeraldas","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/86764.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/86764l.jpg"},"StartDate":null,"DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null},"EndDate":null,"DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null},"Synopsis":"An anime movie that was announced at Japan Expo and was supposed to air in 2020.","Mean":null,"Rank":null,"Popularity":9798,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"}],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Not yet aired","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":null,"Season":null},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":null,"Rating":null,"Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":0,"Completed":0,"OnHold":0,"Dropped":0,"PlanToWatch":2741},"NumListUsers":2741},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T13:59:47.111+02:00"},{"Id":35854,"Title":"Zero Seiki Movie 2: Herlock","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/86658.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/86658l.jpg"},"StartDate":null,"DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null},"EndDate":null,"DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null},"Synopsis":"An anime movie that was announced at Japan Expo which will air in 2023.","Mean":null,"Rank":null,"Popularity":11199,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"}],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Not yet aired","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":null,"Season":null},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":null,"Rating":null,"Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":0,"Completed":0,"OnHold":0,"Dropped":0,"PlanToWatch":1715},"NumListUsers":1715},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T13:59:47.822+02:00"},{"Id":35855,"Title":"Zero Seiki Movie 3: Maetel","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/86659.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/86659l.jpg"},"StartDate":null,"DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null},"EndDate":null,"DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null},"Synopsis":"An anime movie that was announced at Japan Expo which will air in 2026.","Mean":null,"Rank":null,"Popularity":11730,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"}],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Not yet aired","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":null,"Season":null},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":null,"Rating":null,"Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":0,"Completed":0,"OnHold":0,"Dropped":0,"PlanToWatch":1415},"NumListUsers":1415},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T13:59:49.147+02:00"},{"Id":35857,"Title":"Lupin III: Part 5","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1235/91028.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1235/91028l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Apr 04 2018","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2018,"Month":4,"Day":4},"EndDate":"Sep 19 2018","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2018,"Month":9,"Day":19},"Synopsis":"Genius thief Arsene Lupin III\u2014along with the usual crew of Goemon Ishikawa XIII, Fujiko Mine, and Daisuke Jigen\u2014finds himself in modern-day France, where he encounters both new and old adversaries, with Inspector Kouichi Zenigata still hot on his trail.
