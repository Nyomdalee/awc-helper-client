These charms were created by three magicians in a magical world names Jewel Land, each housing one of its many native Jewelpets.

Most Jewelpets don\u0027t find this troublesome, but once a mischievous bunny by the name of Ruby feels overly claustrophobic, she devises her escape.\n\nOne day, the magicians decide to move the Jewelpets, and task a pelican with delivering them to the Dream Forest. All is well until a strong gust of wind disorients the bird, who then drops all of the charms that he was carrying. Instead of heading towards the Dream Forest, all the Jewelpets but Ruby fall to Rinko\u2019s home city on Earth.

The governing rule of the series was that the creative staff change from episode to episode. While later other anime series like Nippon Animation\u0027s Famous Works of Japanese Literature would attempt the same, none would be as long-lived or successful. \n\nThe rotation idea was that of director Sugii Gisaburo, a visual visionary unequaled in Japanese film history who has revolutionized anime several times in his career, be it in the 1967 TV series Goku\u0027s Big Adventure, in which he sought to shake anime free from the dominance of story development by yanking it back to a more cartoonish form, or The Belladonna of Sadness, where he broke the Disney full-animation mold, creating a full-length animated film in a completely new style that was a hybrid of still drawings and animation. The reason for rotating the staff each episode was so that each episode would have a completely different look and feel from its predecessor, and in this it was eminently successful. This is a series that is genuinely rewarding to watch, and is visually one of the richest in anime history. \n\nWhile this system also meant that quality varied, there were also occasionally superb episodes, as on the staff were many veterans like Group Tac founder SUGII Gisaburo himself, SHIBAYAMA Tsutomu, FURUZAWA Hideo, RIN Taro, and HIKONE Norio. Old episodes started being repeated more and more frequently as the years went on, and production of new episodes finally ceased completely in late 1995, but the series is still widely broadcast. \n\n(Source: Pelleas)","Mean":6.19,"Rank":8310,"Popularity":11513,"Genres":[{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"},{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1471,"StartSeason":{"Year":1976,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Unknown","AverageEpisodeDuration":1500,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":76,"Completed":603,"OnHold":88,"Dropped":213,"PlanToWatch":542},"NumListUsers":1522},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T21:51:18.163+02:00"},{"Id":6280,"Title":"Cat Shit One","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1006/116460.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1006/116460l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Jul 17 2010","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2010,"Month":7,"Day":17},"EndDate":"Jul 17 2010","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2010,"Month":7,"Day":17},"Synopsis":"The Carrot Military Service special unit, Cat Shit One, is an elite private military fighting force.

Luckily, a chance encounter with Natsu Dragneel, the \u0022Salamander\u0022 of Fairy Tail, whisks her into the legendary guild.\n\nFrom Natsu\u0027s rivalrous antics with ice wizard Gray Fullbuster to the frightening presence of the unmatched combat goddess Erza Scarlet, Fairy Tail\u0027s powerful mages have a slight penchant for trouble. Through all the lucrative odd jobs and adventures to save the world from destruction lies an absolute and unyielding trust stronger than family that has formed between each guild member.\n\nTeaming up with Natsu, Gray, and Erza, Lucy finds herself amidst the guild\u0027s most misfit wizards. But as they constantly stand in the eye of every danger, there is one name that never ceases to resurface: Zeref, the feared master of dark magic.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n","Mean":7.57,"Rank":1499,"Popularity":50,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"},{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":175,"StartSeason":{"Year":2009,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Saturday","StartTime":"10:30"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1484,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":219858,"Completed":959682,"OnHold":134221,"Dropped":195021,"PlanToWatch":183324},"NumListUsers":1692106},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T21:54:10.843+02:00"},{"Id":6704,"Title":"Queen\u0027s Blade: Rurou no Senshi Specials","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/22751.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/22751l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Jun 25 2009","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2009,"Month":6,"Day":25},"EndDate":"Nov 25 2009","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2009,"Month":11,"Day":25},"Synopsis":"Special episodes added to DVDs and Blu-rays.","Mean":5.97,"Rank":9410,"Popularity":5145,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":9,"Name":"Ecchi"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"}],"MediaType":"Special","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":6,"StartSeason":{"Year":2009,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Other","AverageEpisodeDuration":174,"Rating":"R\u002B","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":686,"Completed":9287,"OnHold":402,"Dropped":374,"PlanToWatch":4518},"NumListUsers":15267},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T21:54:11.857+02:00"},{"Id":6705,"Title":"Tayutayu: Pure My Heart","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/15398.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/15398l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Jun 25 2009","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2009,"Month":6,"Day":25},"EndDate":"Nov 25 2009","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2009,"Month":11,"Day":25},"Synopsis":"Special Tayutama -Kiss on my Deity- episodes added to DVDs and Blu-rays.","Mean":6.33,"Rank":7548,"Popularity":6647,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"}],"MediaType":"Special","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":6,"StartSeason":{"Year":2009,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Visual Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":180,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":399,"Completed":4344,"OnHold":189,"Dropped":169,"PlanToWatch":3052},"NumListUsers":8153},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T21:54:12.586+02:00"},{"Id":6707,"Title":"Kuroshitsuji II","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/50499.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/50499l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Jul 02 2010","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2010,"Month":7,"Day":2},"EndDate":"Sep 17 2010","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2010,"Month":9,"Day":17},"Synopsis":"The stage of Kuroshitsuji II opens on the life of Alois Trancy, the young heir to the Trancy earldom.
