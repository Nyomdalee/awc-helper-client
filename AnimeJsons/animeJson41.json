Arte, a delightful young lady from an aristocratic family, dreams of being an artist and contributing to the renewal of civilization. However, with her father\u0027s death, she ends up losing the only person who believed in her passion for art. Now she is expected to marry a nobleman and live as a refined housewife without disgracing her family name. Reluctant to accept her fate, the headstrong Arte steps into the streets in search of a master artisan to take her on as an apprentice.\n\nIn her quest for a mentor, Arte has to face harsh reality when she is completely shunned for being a female artist. No one believes that women are capable of fine craftsmanship, and therefore none are willing to accept her. Luckily, a renowned artisan by the name of Leo is persuaded to take her as his disciple since he has none anyway. And thus, Arte\u0027s new life begins, far from the comfort of her noble upbringing.

They travel to a shelter, but their parents\u0027 inability to hear and speak causes misunderstandings and conflict among the workers; Rieko helps resolve the situation while also keeping an eye on her younger sister.\n\nWith support from volunteer worker Kyoko, an older girl from Tokyo, the community within the shelter begin to grow and understand one another. Rieko helps keep the younger ones amused with her drawings of Bomberman characters, including a comic of the heroes and villains putting their differences aside to help each other when the battle arena comes down on top of them.\n\nThe film ends with a short public safety video from the Bomberman gang, offering pointers on how to safeguard against damage in your house and how to stay safe if you need to evacuate.\n\nDespite the prominent branding on the marketing materials, the Bomberman content is shockingly minimal. Rieko creates comic strips of Bomberman and friends to entertain her younger sister and children at the shelter, leading into animated vignettes with the cast of Super Bomberman 3; these three segments amount to only three minutes\n\n(Source: randomhoohaas.flyingomelette.com)","Mean":null,"Rank":18100,"Popularity":16248,"Genres":[{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":15,"Name":"Kids"},{"Id":11,"Name":"Strategy Game"}],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":1995,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Game","AverageEpisodeDuration":1560,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":21,"Completed":160,"OnHold":11,"Dropped":42,"PlanToWatch":156},"NumListUsers":390},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T15:15:26.106+02:00"},{"Id":40302,"Title":"Ninja Bugei-chou Pilot Film","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1629/102770.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1629/102770l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Apr 25 2000","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2000,"Month":4,"Day":25},"EndDate":"Apr 25 2000","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2000,"Month":4,"Day":25},"Synopsis":"An animated pilot film for Ninja Bugei-chou released to the public over three decades later on Ninpuu Kamui Gaiden DVD volume 7.\n\nThe pilot film was created in 1969 as director Nagisa Ooshima was wanting to make a TV animation to build off his controversial film from 1967.
