Maia, the series\u0027 protagonist, is set to become one of the few.\n\nBut her ideal life quickly falls apart. To her disappointment, Maia unexpectedly fails her entrance exams. Making matters worse, she promptly gets evicted from her house, pick pocketed, taken hostage, then shot. She is \u0022saved\u0022 by two women (Rena and Shizuka) that are part of an unorthodox help-for-hire organization called Nereids (inspired by the Greek mythological Nereids ). With nowhere to go, Maia joins up with Nereids, taking jobs from capturing wanted criminals to chasing stray cats, often with unexpected results. Gloria and Yu later join up with Nereids.\n\n\u0022Daphne\u0022 in the title refers to a subplot that starts midway into the series and eventually become important to Maia. \u0022Brilliant Blue\u0022 refers to the fact that this is a world covered by water with almost no land.

Finally, they could successfully control their power by putting a special helmet on.\n\nThe newly developed helmet, \u0022Musumet\u0022, was as large as an automobile helmet. Putting Musumet on the head, it turned a person\u0027s body into the strongest one on the earth. Furthermore, it received the signal from the brain and amplified the inherent power and ability unlimitedly.\n\nTo utilize the power of \u0022Musumet\u0022, to keep the world peace, and to protect from the disasters caused by the remaining shooting stars, Dr. Mishima and Dr. Kishida founded a secret organization \u0022MET\u0022. However, he died before he accomplished his aim.\n\nThe bereaved daughters, Aoi, Midori, and Kurenai, made up their minds to become Musmet in order to execute the father\u0027s will.\n\nEven if they turned into Musumet, their wearing wouldn\u0027t change except helmets, gloves, and boots. Therefore, they had to go to the scenes wearing their own clothes. The girls had to go to the incident spots occasionally wearing school uniforms, occasionally gymnasium suits, occasionally swimming suits, depending the case, they had to go there even if they were naked, and they would do great jobs. On the other hand, at other times, they were ordinal adolescent girls who were dreaming of lovely meetings with boyfriends.\n\nWhether would they cope with the world peace and boyfriends at the same time? \n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)","Mean":6.14,"Rank":8576,"Popularity":9508,"Genres":[{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":9,"Name":"Ecchi"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":13,"StartSeason":{"Year":2004,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":1500,"Rating":"R","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":158,"Completed":1267,"OnHold":120,"Dropped":202,"PlanToWatch":1330},"NumListUsers":3077},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T21:00:00.053+02:00"},{"Id":1712,"Title":"Shinseikiden Mars","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1/1712.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1/1712l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Oct 31 2002","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2002,"Month":10,"Day":31},"EndDate":"Feb 06 2003","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2003,"Month":2,"Day":6},"Synopsis":"Mars is discovered on a forming volcano island, Heisei; a man with no memory.

His day, however, takes a turn for the extraordinary when he witnesses everyone around him freeze in place and is left the only one able to move. Immediately, a Rinne begins devouring the souls of those around him, but as the creature sets its sights on Yuuji, a katana-wielding Flame Haze with blazing red hair saves him.\n\nAfter his protector fixes the damage done, she explains why Yuuji was able to move: he has become a Torch, a remnant of a dead human being that will eventually fade from memory. Furthermore, he is also a Mystes, a Torch that houses an unknown treasure. Before his flame burns out completely, a Crimson Denizen will try to seize the treasure he holds, so the fiery hunter decides to watch over him. As Yuuji comes to terms with being dead, he resolves to live his life the best he can with the time he has remaining.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.37,"Rank":2281,"Popularity":2620,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"},{"Id":66,"Name":"Mahou Shoujo"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"},{"Id":23,"Name":"School"}],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2007,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Light Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":5400,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":1058,"Completed":44365,"OnHold":800,"Dropped":564,"PlanToWatch":15736},"NumListUsers":62523},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T21:01:37.965+02:00"},{"Id":1816,"Title":"Sonic X","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1801/121070.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1801/121070l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Apr 06 2003","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2003,"Month":4,"Day":6},"EndDate":"Mar 28 2004","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2004,"Month":3,"Day":28},"Synopsis":"Sonic the Hedgehog\u0027s typical irreverence leads to the coveted chaos emeralds being caught in the crossfire and rendered unstable just before activation.
