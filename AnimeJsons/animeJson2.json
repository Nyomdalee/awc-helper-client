Though out of sight and mind for the majority of Earth\u0027s inhabitants, the conflict still rages on Fairy, where the United Nations has established five bases and a powerful, technologically advanced military\u2014including the Fairy Air Force (FAF).\n\nLieutenant Rei Fukai acts as a pilot for the FAF Special Air Force\u2019s Boomerang reconnaissance squadron, flying a Super Sylph fighter jet with the personal name \u0022Yukikaze.\u0022 Soaring high above and observing the battles for air superiority, he is responsible for collecting and analyzing valuable intelligence on JAM methods. While his flying skills are unmatched, he also heavily relies on the highly advanced weaponry and near-sentient AI system of his aircraft. \n\nThough despised by other members of the FAF for his antisocial and standoffish nature, Lt. Fukai continues to carry out his duties along with Yukikaze. However, during a particularly bloody battle, the appearance of an unresponsive and hostile aircraft catches the lieutenant off-guard\u2014an aircraft which is of the same make and model as his own.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n","Mean":7.2,"Rank":3114,"Popularity":4773,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":46,"Name":"Award Winning"},{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"},{"Id":41,"Name":"Suspense"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":38,"Name":"Military"},{"Id":40,"Name":"Psychological"},{"Id":29,"Name":"Space"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"OVA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":5,"StartSeason":{"Year":2002,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":2220,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":958,"Completed":8061,"OnHold":575,"Dropped":600,"PlanToWatch":8680,"Total":18874},"Favorites":179,"Producers":["Bandai Visual"],"Licensors":["Bandai Entertainment"],"Studios":["Gonzo"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Engage\u0022 by Monsieur Kamayatsu"],"Endings":["\u0022RTB\u0022 by Monsieur Kamayatsu"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=111","LastUpdated":"2023-08-30T20:19:24.448+02:00"},{"Id":1081,"Title":"Space Pirate Captain Herlock: Outside Legend - The Endless Odyssey","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1543/106174.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2002,"Month":12,"Day":21,"Full":"2002-12-21"},"EndDate":{"Year":2003,"Month":12,"Day":21,"Full":"2003-12-21"},"Synopsis":"On an archaelogical mission to the end of the known universe, Professor Daiba unwitting unleashes an ancient horror from its confines.
