There\u0027s a little disclaimer at the front that says \u0022This is non-fiction, so I apologize for the lack of drama,\u0022 and indeed, it mostly is just about them riding trains from place to place, waiting on platforms, etc. \n\nThe \u0022travel writer\u0022 turns out to be a super train-otaku who has vast knowledge of the train network, but also micro-manages all their trips, planning every detail down to the second. He cares mostly about following the schedule and successfully achieving his planned goals (e.g. visiting all stations on a line in a completely bizarre order to accomodate infrequent trains). The mangaka doesn\u0027t really care about trains; she\u0027s cynical, sarcastic, and rather lazy (she mainly just looks forward to the next eki-ben); he\u0027s completely gung-ho as long as he\u0027s following the schedule, and the inevitable conflicts are pretty entertaining. \n\nThroughout, though, it feels real \u2014if you\u0027ve travelled by train in Japan it will all seem very familiar, not just the scenery, but also the atmosphere and feel\u2014 and the artist does a great job of pacing and applying little tweaks to keep it consistently entertaining. In an additional bit of recursiveness, some of the characters who show up in the manga (who of course are real people, who really did show up) do so because they (really) read previous episodes of the manga! \n\nIn addition of course, you can learn about various out of the way and interesting Japanese train lines and stations; some of them really do look cool. There\u0027s always this vague sense of surreality about it however, the trips are all planned by the train-guy (goal: visit all 9,843 stations in Japan) who seems to consider everything as part of a checklist rather than an experience to be enjoyed. You learn a bit about train-otaku culture too; there\u0027s really only the one guy in the story, but train-otaku culture is a sort of constant peripheral presence. \n\n(Source: AniDB) ","Mean":6.26,"Rank":7971,"Popularity":9898,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":42,"Name":"Seinen"},{"Id":36,"Name":"Slice of Life"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":13,"StartSeason":{"Year":2007,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1470,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":214,"Completed":580,"OnHold":186,"Dropped":273,"PlanToWatch":1395},"NumListUsers":2648},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T21:13:19.71+02:00"},{"Id":2553,"Title":"Flanders no Inu","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/17492.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/17492l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Jan 05 1975","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":1975,"Month":1,"Day":5},"EndDate":"Dec 28 1975","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":1975,"Month":12,"Day":28},"Synopsis":"Nello Tarth is a poor but happy orphan who lives with his grandfather Jehan in a little village nearby Antwerp.

One day, a puppet he is carving out of wood begins to speak even before he has finished shaping it. The old man names the puppet Pinocchio, and treats him as the son he never had. The puppet is dreadfully naughty and causes trouble for the old man, but his heart is in the right place and he earns Jeppet\u2019s love as though he were a human son. However, tragedy befalls the pair. Pinocchio is deceived by the wicked fox Dino and his sidekick, the cat Witch, while on his way to school. Pinocchio and his friend Gina the duck are sold to the master of a puppet show, with little hope of ever reuniting with kind old Jeppet. The naughty puppet eventually runs away in order to search for his surrogate father, and finds himself in the middle of adventure after adventure, matching wits with the crafty Dino and Witch. His efforts to stay out of mischief never seem to work, and misfortune always seeks out our wooden hero. If Pinocchio can only manage to stay out of trouble, his ultimate wish will be granted and his dream will become a reality.

Its plain depiction of the austere reality of what it would be like to be literally subhuman growing up in a world of danger and hardship, makes this another good example of traditional Japanese stories, which teach moral observance through tough endurance.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","Mean":6.24,"Rank":8035,"Popularity":10657,"Genres":[{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":52,"StartSeason":{"Year":1972,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Unknown","AverageEpisodeDuration":1460,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":84,"Completed":1180,"OnHold":79,"Dropped":199,"PlanToWatch":540},"NumListUsers":2082},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T21:13:42.444+02:00"},{"Id":2575,"Title":"Don Chuck Monogatari","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/60421.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/60421l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Apr 05 1975","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":1975,"Month":4,"Day":5},"EndDate":"Sep 27 1975","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":1975,"Month":9,"Day":27},"Synopsis":"Young beaver Chuck\u0027s adventure with his little friends.

Of course, there\u0027s also lots of traffic to contend with, including a fair number of heavy trucks. Because of this, the action is inherently hazardous, and wrecks are common. Blown engines are also a frequent hazard, especially with the extreme-high power engines. \n\nOne day, Akio Asakura, a third year high school student, is driving his Fairlady Z (Z31) and is challenged by Tatsuya Shima, a doctor, in his black Porsche 964 Turbo (nicknamed the \u0022BlackBird\u0022). With a friend in the passenger seat and two girls in the back, Akio pitifully tries to win, but is defeated. Determined to become faster, he goes to the junkyard to buy parts for his car, when he sees a pristine, unscratched midnight blue Fairlady Z (S30) in the junkyard.

Princess Aura rules Mugen, which is an island continent hanging over an ocean from the skybound Novel Pole. The Great God Goal gives her power, but she may never leave the small palace island area. Their nemesis is the forgotten Spirit of Cats, Nyanma (real name, Chocolat), who was excluded from the choice of 12 protectors by being disqualified from the race (in actual legend there are many versions of this story). She seeks her revenge by distorting Novel Worlds with Jarei Monsters.\n\nWhen a Jarei Monster goes to a Novel World they alter the story, turning it into a different version, sometimes a parody of itself. Bakumaru, the Spirit of Mice, must use the Genmakyou mirror to reveal (\u0022Jarei Shouran!\u0022) the evil spirit once enough clues lead to its identity.

The manga on which it is based is one of the much-read works produced for adolescent Japanese girls that features a healthy proportion of gay men and beautiful teenagers aka bishounen (beautiful boys). Most of the action takes place in Marinera, the land of eternal spring, located somewhere in the South Seas. The country is a major producer of diamonds; they provide much of the basis of conflict in the anime series. They come from one of the most prolific mines in the world, owned by the king of Marinera, the vertically challenged but horizontally endowed boy-king Patarillo himself. The International Diamond Syndicate - a huge semi- criminal organization/ secret society dedicated to taking over the world\u0027s entire diamond supply- wants that mine and will stop at nothing to get it. In the early episodes they send off a number of bishounen assassins to do in Patarillo, which necessitates his having a bodyguard, the English MI6 agent, Major Jack (\u0027Bishounen-Killer\u0027) Bancoran. Bancoran\u0027s nickname doesn\u0027t mean he shoots bishounen in cold blood. The soubriquet comes from the fact that no male under the age of 17 can resist his sexual fascination. This, to Bancoran\u0027s eternal disgust, includes Patarillo himself. The action switches often from Marinera to MI6 headquarters in London (London seems to be an easy two hour\u0027s flight from the South Seas) or Bancoran\u0027s palatial condo in the suburbs of same. (MI6, be it noted, looks a lot like Fritz Lang\u0027s Metropolis, while Jack\u0027s \u0027apartment\u0027 bears a passing resemblance to Randolph Hearst\u0027s spread.) The action also goes into the past and future and out into space. Patarillo evidently gets around.\n\n(Source: aestheticism.com)","Mean":7.25,"Rank":2871,"Popularity":6733,"Genres":[{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":28,"Name":"Boys Love"},{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":25,"Name":"Shoujo"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":49,"StartSeason":{"Year":1982,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Thrusday","StartTime":"19:00"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1475,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":888,"Completed":1197,"OnHold":770,"Dropped":564,"PlanToWatch":4512},"NumListUsers":7931},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T21:18:36.699+02:00"},{"Id":2836,"Title":"Chiisana Viking Vickie","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/3940.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/3940l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Apr 03 1974","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":1974,"Month":4,"Day":3},"EndDate":"Sep 24 1975","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":1975,"Month":9,"Day":24},"Synopsis":"Long ago, in a little Viking Village called Flake, young Wickie lives a happy life.

Near the epicenter of the activity, the expedition discovers vast land markings akin to the Nazca paleoglyphs drawn in the Peruvian desert. Stranger still is the presence of an enormous underground cavern below these symbols. At the bottom of the chasm, a portion of a tremendous tower juts from the ground. Armed with ultra-digital cameras, the scientific team transmits their findings to the Command Center. One explorer traces the image of a star chart engraved on the tower\u0027s exterior. The tower begins to emit a sinister howling as if possessed by demonic forces. One by one, the members of the expedition writhe in pain and die. Those observing the scene at the Command Center watch helplessly. As the high-frequency noise suffuses their headquarters, they too succumb and die in agony. When the waves of the frequency are analyzed, they are discovered to be a beacon directed at the planet Elysium, which lies beyond Earth\u0027s solar system.\n\nVan, the reluctant hero of the story, is an 18-year-old pizza delivery boy in Manhattan. He competes in the most popular sport of the 22nd century -- turbo jai alai racing. These races are fast paced and deadly affairs that integrate virtual reality into the competition. He\u0027s deeply in love with Lydia, a talented ballerina. In the chaotic futuristic metropolis, they only have each other and their dreams. Van and Lydia desperately want the chance to escape the polluted city-scape. Despite the dangers, Van enters a turbo jai alai race in the hopes of winning first prize -- two tickets to a galactic resort where Lydia can audition for the Jupiter Ballet.\n\nMeanwhile, earth\u0027s deep space observation vessel, the Odyssey, patrols the planet\u0027s orbital perimeter. The Odyssey is confronted by an armada of sophisticated alien spacecraft from Elysium. The awed human crew prepares to receive the Elysian ambassador, Yaspe. Without warning, the Odyssey loses control of its weapons, fires on the ambassador\u0027s vessel and destroys it. This tragic misunderstanding results in brutal retaliation by the Elysian fleet, culminating in the destruction of the Odyssey and a full-scale attack on Earth.\n\nVan\u0027s deadly sport of choice turns deadlier when the stadium he is competing in comes under fire from the Elysian barrage. Van struggles through the chaos on his turbo-cycle to rescue Lydia from the collapsing stands. The indiscriminate Elysian onslaught scorches cities worldwide. Van and Lydia flee through the burning streets of Manhattan seeking safety. After a series of harrowing escapes, they find refuge in a claustrophobic fall-out shelter. \n\n(Source: AniDB)","Mean":5.24,"Rank":11906,"Popularity":11616,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":18,"Name":"Mecha"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"}],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2003,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Unknown","AverageEpisodeDuration":5165,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":40,"Completed":982,"OnHold":20,"Dropped":84,"PlanToWatch":351},"NumListUsers":1477},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T21:19:51.164+02:00"},{"Id":2942,"Title":"Sketchbook: Full Color\u0027s","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1763/137274.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1763/137274l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Oct 02 2007","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2007,"Month":10,"Day":2},"EndDate":"Dec 25 2007","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2007,"Month":12,"Day":25},"Synopsis":"To Sora Kajiwara, the world is full of wonderful and adorable things she wants to draw\u2014cats being a popular object of her affection.
