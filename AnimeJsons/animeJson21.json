Doctor Yukinari Ookido has dedicated his life to studying these fascinating beings, that can be caught, trained, traded, and battled against each other. There\u0027s only so much he can do from his lab though. With this in mind, Ookido entrusts two young boys with a Pok\u00E9mon of their own and a computerized encyclopedia to catalog them. One of them, Green, is brash, passionate, slightly arrogant, and Doctor Ookido\u0027s own nephew. The other boy, Red, is equally passionate, and filled with a wide-eyed, mildly naive sense of wonder.\n\nPok\u00E9mon: The Origin follows Red in his journey through the region of Kanto in his attempt to complete his \u0022Pok\u00E9dex\u0022 by capturing and cataloging all the Pok\u00E9mon that exist.

There are others who capture and train Pok\u00E9mon for more sinister reasons, with the infamous criminal organization Team Rocket being one of them. If Red can defeat them, fellow trainers, his rival Green, and wild Pok\u00E9mon all through Kanto, he just may fulfill his own dream, and Doctor Ookido\u0027s as well.","Mean":7.73,"Rank":1081,"Popularity":1003,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"},{"Id":15,"Name":"Kids"}],"MediaType":"Special","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":4,"StartSeason":{"Year":2013,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Game","AverageEpisodeDuration":1299,"Rating":"PG","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":3631,"Completed":205624,"OnHold":1657,"Dropped":1248,"PlanToWatch":14486},"NumListUsers":226646},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-08T12:59:32.668+02:00"},{"Id":20173,"Title":"Mori no Senshi Bonolon","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/53719.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/53719l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Nov 05 2007","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2007,"Month":11,"Day":5},"EndDate":"May 17 2008","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2008,"Month":5,"Day":17},"Synopsis":"Bonolon is touted as the warrior who comes from the forest of the great oaks.

President Shino Amakusa is just as perverted as ever, Secretary Aria Shichijou still refuses to put on a pair of panties, Treasurer Suzu Hagimura has yet to grow an inch, and Vice President Takatoshi Tsuda is still stuck as the straight man to their crazy antics.\n \nOf course, limiting the fun to a four-way might get a little stale; although the group still messes around with the Judo Club and the Newspaper Club, more girls have come to get in on the excitement. Takatoshi\u0027s sister Kotomi, a new student at Ousai, is as perverse as the president, while Uomi, the aloof student council president of the nearby Eiryou High School, fits right in with the insanity at Ousai. With loads of absurdity and sexual humor that keeps on coming, Takatoshi needs to harden up if he is going to keep up with all the madness around him.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.69,"Rank":1188,"Popularity":920,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":57,"Name":"Gag Humor"},{"Id":23,"Name":"School"},{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":13,"StartSeason":{"Year":2014,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"4-koma Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1420,"Rating":"R","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":12981,"Completed":162717,"OnHold":7259,"Dropped":5653,"PlanToWatch":60341},"NumListUsers":248951},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-08T13:11:14.738+02:00"},{"Id":20849,"Title":"Oni Chichi 2: Revenge","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1002/103860.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1002/103860l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Nov 29 2013","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2013,"Month":11,"Day":29},"EndDate":"Mar 28 2014","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2014,"Month":3,"Day":28},"Synopsis":"Three of the Makino sisters\u2014Natsume, Akira, and Fuyu\u2014plan to attend a school training camp at the beach.
