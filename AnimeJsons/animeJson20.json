Punch is a bear who is literally strong-headed: his head is as hard as a rock, and nothing can knock him down. Boom the weasel is an expert shot, using not a gun, but a slingshot. Touch the mouse takes advantage of her smallness in order to get into small holes and sneaking into things without the villains knowing. \n\nGari-Gari is a mad scientist wolf who wants to build a mansion over the junkyard, constantly thinking up evil plans to get the money needed to buy the property, whether it\u2019s creating a machine that creates counterfeit 10 yen (about 10 cents in US money) or stealing priceless paintings and selling it to a high bidder. He is an inventor, creating things that can aid him into doing his deed. If Gari-Gari buys the junkyard, this of course means that the three heroes will have no place to stay, so they constantly thwart his schemes. Gari-Gari has two henchmen working for him: Black and Nyu. Black is a gangster cat who welds a gun, often shooting at Punch and the gang with it. Nyu is a simple-minded pig who has big strength. \n\n(Source: Cartoon Research)\n\n*Based on Hustle Punch by Mori Yasuji, serialized in Manga O.","Mean":null,"Rank":16924,"Popularity":13982,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"},{"Id":15,"Name":"Kids"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":26,"StartSeason":{"Year":1965,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":1511,"Rating":"PG","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":43,"Completed":168,"OnHold":65,"Dropped":139,"PlanToWatch":278},"NumListUsers":693},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-08T12:51:25.819"},{"Id":19685,"Title":"Kanojo ga Flag wo Oraretara","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/63363.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/63363l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Apr 07 2014","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2014,"Month":4,"Day":7},"EndDate":"Jun 30 2014","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2014,"Month":6,"Day":30},"Synopsis":"In visual novels, an imaginary flag is defined as an event that serves as a turning point for the whole story.

We definitely have a common warm heart and a moment we have to use it with honest feeling. This film could remind us some important things we should never forget about our life.\n\n(Source: AniDB)","Mean":null,"Rank":15729,"Popularity":15852,"Genres":[{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":23,"Name":"School"},{"Id":36,"Name":"Slice of Life"}],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2007,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Book","AverageEpisodeDuration":4800,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":24,"Completed":106,"OnHold":9,"Dropped":56,"PlanToWatch":229},"NumListUsers":424},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-08T12:55:13.597"},{"Id":19907,"Title":"Ecchan no Sensou","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/53079.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/53079l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Jan 13 2002","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2002,"Month":1,"Day":13},"EndDate":"Jan 13 2002","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2002,"Month":1,"Day":13},"Synopsis":"Based on a children\u0027s novel by Etsuko Kishikawa.","Mean":null,"Rank":16047,"Popularity":15936,"Genres":[{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"}],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2002,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":4800,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":24,"Completed":92,"OnHold":13,"Dropped":61,"PlanToWatch":226},"NumListUsers":416},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-08T12:55:15.916"},{"Id":19909,"Title":"Pipi Tobenai Hotaru","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/53081.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/53081l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Mar 23 1996","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":1996,"Month":3,"Day":23},"EndDate":"Mar 23 1996","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":1996,"Month":3,"Day":23},"Synopsis":"Based on the fairy tale novel series by Akira Ozawa (\u5C0F\u6CA2\u662D\u5DF3).","Mean":null,"Rank":19126,"Popularity":16871,"Genres":[{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"}],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":1996,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":5400,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":22,"Completed":114,"OnHold":8,"Dropped":64,"PlanToWatch":136},"NumListUsers":344},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-08T12:55:17.965"},{"Id":19917,"Title":"Nijuushi no Hitomi","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/53117.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/53117l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Oct 10 1980","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":1980,"Month":10,"Day":10},"EndDate":"Oct 10 1980","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":1980,"Month":10,"Day":10},"Synopsis":"Based on the book by Tsuboi Sakae, which drew on her involvement in Japan\u0027s anarchist counterculture and opposition to Korean War rearmament.\n\nCombined live action (handled by Akio Jissoji) and animation (handled by Shigetsugu Yoshida).\nReleased as a TV special.\n\n(Source: AniDB)","Mean":null,"Rank":18745,"Popularity":16687,"Genres":[{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"}],"MediaType":"Special","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":1980,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":null,"AverageEpisodeDuration":4200,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":21,"Completed":116,"OnHold":7,"Dropped":81,"PlanToWatch":132},"NumListUsers":357},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-08T12:55:25.83"},{"Id":19919,"Title":"Tesagure!
