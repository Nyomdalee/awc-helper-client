Upon holding the scroll, a sudden glow emanates, leaving a strange mark on Tousuke\u0027s forehead.\n\nThinking that he\u0027s received the means to free himself and his friends from their daily treatment, Tousuke is shocked to find out that its effects are far different than what he had imagined. Although his bullying continues, he realizes that the mark from the scroll acts as a charm, capturing the hearts of delinquent girls\u2014in particular, Ranna Himawari, the strongest of them all.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":6.43,"Rank":7053,"Popularity":3264,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":55,"Name":"Delinquents"},{"Id":35,"Name":"Harem"},{"Id":23,"Name":"School"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2023,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Saturday","StartTime":"01:35"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1420,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":8360,"Completed":16110,"OnHold":1035,"Dropped":4470,"PlanToWatch":11829,"Total":41804},"Favorites":97,"Producers":["Mainichi Broadcasting System","NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan","Akita Shoten","Crunchyroll","Live Viewing Japan","MAGNET","Mixer","BS Asahi","HIAN"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Satelight"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022ENDLESS LABYRINTH\u0022 by EverdreaM"],"Endings":["\u0022Love Will Find A Way\u0022 by THE RAMPAGE from EXILE TRIBE"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=17825","LastUpdated":"2023-09-08T22:18:03.3084473Z"},{"Id":54261,"Title":"Bing Zhu Qi Hun Part 2","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1685/132802.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2023,"Month":1,"Day":24,"Full":"2023-01-24"},"EndDate":{"Year":2023,"Month":4,"Day":4,"Full":"2023-04-04"},"Synopsis":"","Mean":null,"Rank":18169,"Popularity":16302,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"},{"Id":17,"Name":"Martial Arts"},{"Id":6,"Name":"Mythology"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"ONA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2023,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":null,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":66,"Completed":92,"OnHold":8,"Dropped":55,"PlanToWatch":171,"Total":392},"Favorites":1,"Producers":["bilibili"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["HuaDream"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2023-09-08T22:18:03.3084719Z"},{"Id":54262,"Title":"Dokusou Shuusa","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1133/132804.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2022,"Month":9,"Day":12,"Full":"2022-09-12"},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"2022-09-12"},"Synopsis":"Music video for the song Dokusou Shuusa by Afterglow.","Mean":6.26,"Rank":null,"Popularity":18414,"Genres":[],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":19,"Name":"Music"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"Music","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2022,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Mixed Media","AverageEpisodeDuration":278,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Watching":9,"Completed":177,"OnHold":4,"Dropped":14,"PlanToWatch":41,"Total":245},"Favorites":0,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["SIGNIF"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2023-09-08T22:18:03.3084904Z"},{"Id":54265,"Title":"Kekkon Yubiwa Monogatari","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1820/134738.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2024,"Month":1,"Day":1,"Full":"2024"},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":null},"Synopsis":"Satou has been in love with his childhood friend and neighbor, Hime, ever since she and her grandfather appeared out of nowhere 10 years ago.

Still, she manages to retain her curious and pragmatic spirit, planning to work until her years of servitude are over. One day, however, she catches wind of the fact that the emperor\u0027s two infants have fallen gravely ill. She decides to secretly take action, drawing on her experience as a pharmacist raised in the poor red-light district.\n\nDespite Maomao\u0027s attempts to remain anonymous, she soon catches the eye of Jinshi, an influential eunuch who recognizes her talents. Maomao soon finds herself in the emperor\u0027s inner court, where she gradually makes a name for herself by utilizing her knowledge and eccentric personality to solve various medical mysteries.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":null,"Rank":null,"Popularity":3237,"Genres":[{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":7,"Name":"Mystery"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"},{"Id":67,"Name":"Medical"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Not yet aired","NumEpisodes":null,"StartSeason":{"Year":2023,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Sunday","StartTime":"01:05"},"Source":"Light Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":null,"Rating":null,"Statistics":{"Watching":3,"Completed":0,"OnHold":1,"Dropped":0,"PlanToWatch":42425,"Total":42429},"Favorites":320,"Producers":["TOHO animation"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["OLM","TOHO animation STUDIO"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=17870","LastUpdated":"2023-09-08T22:18:03.3110564Z"},{"Id":54494,"Title":"Bokura Taiyou wo Mannaka ni","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1774/133409.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2001,"Month":1,"Day":1,"Full":"2001"},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"2001"},"Synopsis":"","Mean":null,"Rank":18219,"Popularity":23815,"Genres":[{"Id":36,"Name":"Slice of Life"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":null,"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":882,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Watching":2,"Completed":18,"OnHold":2,"Dropped":13,"PlanToWatch":14,"Total":49},"Favorites":0,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":[],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2023-09-08T22:18:03.3110733Z"},{"Id":54495,"Title":"Kyoukai Senki: Kyokkou no Souki","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1679/135836.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2023,"Month":8,"Day":10,"Full":"2023-08-10"},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":null},"Synopsis":"New entry in the Kyoukai Senki franchise.","Mean":null,"Rank":15222,"Popularity":9940,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":18,"Name":"Mecha"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"ONA","Status":"Currently Airing","NumEpisodes":6,"StartSeason":{"Year":2023,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":600,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":500,"Completed":0,"OnHold":35,"Dropped":26,"PlanToWatch":2077,"Total":2638},"Favorites":7,"Producers":["Bandai Spirits"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Sunrise Beyond"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Yobu Koe ga Naru Hougaku e (\u547C\u3076\u58F0\u304C\u9CF4\u308B\u65B9\u89D2\u3078)\u0022 by Organic Call"],"Endings":["\u0022I\u0027ll Be There\u0022 by LINKL PLANET"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=17871","LastUpdated":"2023-09-08T22:18:03.3110946Z"},{"Id":54496,"Title":"\u0022Ai\u0022 wo Taberu","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1199/133411.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2018,"Month":1,"Day":1,"Full":"2018"},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"2018"},"Synopsis":"Graduate Work 2018 by Yuuta Watanabe, Tokyo Polytechnic University, Faculty of Arts, Department of Animation.","Mean":null,"Rank":17658,"Popularity":22619,"Genres":[{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":null,"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":487,"Rating":"PG","Statistics":{"Watching":3,"Completed":40,"OnHold":0,"Dropped":9,"PlanToWatch":11,"Total":63},"Favorites":0,"Producers":["Tokyo Polytechnic University"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":[],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":null,"LastUpdated":"2023-09-08T22:18:03.3111117Z"},{"Id":54498,"Title":"Movin\u0027 feat.
