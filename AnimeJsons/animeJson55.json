Still, she manages to retain her curious and pragmatic spirit, planning to work until her years of servitude are over. One day, however, she catches wind of the fact that the emperor\u0027s two infants have fallen gravely ill. She decides to secretly take action, drawing on her experience as a pharmacist raised in the poor red-light district.\n\nDespite Maomao\u0027s attempts to remain anonymous, she soon catches the eye of Jinshi, an influential eunuch who recognizes her talents. Maomao soon finds herself in the emperor\u0027s inner court, where she gradually makes a name for herself by utilizing her knowledge and eccentric personality to solve various medical mysteries.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":null,"Rank":null,"Popularity":3501,"Genres":[{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"},{"Id":67,"Name":"Medical"},{"Id":7,"Name":"Mystery"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Not yet aired","NumEpisodes":0,"StartSeason":{"Year":2023,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Light Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":0,"Rating":null,"Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":4,"Completed":1,"OnHold":3,"Dropped":0,"PlanToWatch":36749},"NumListUsers":36757},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T19:58:59.878+02:00"},{"Id":54494,"Title":"Bokura Taiyou wo Mannaka ni","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1774/133409.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1774/133409l.jpg"},"StartDate":"2001","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2001,"Month":null,"Day":null},"EndDate":"2001","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2001,"Month":null,"Day":null},"Synopsis":"","Mean":null,"Rank":18097,"Popularity":23637,"Genres":[{"Id":36,"Name":"Slice of Life"}],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":null,"Season":null},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":882,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":2,"Completed":18,"OnHold":2,"Dropped":11,"PlanToWatch":15},"NumListUsers":48},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T19:59:02.238+02:00"},{"Id":54495,"Title":"Kyoukai Senki: Kyokkou no Souki","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1679/135836.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1679/135836l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Aug 10 2023","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2023,"Month":8,"Day":10},"EndDate":null,"DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null},"Synopsis":"New entry in the Kyoukai Senki franchise.","Mean":null,"Rank":15111,"Popularity":10339,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":18,"Name":"Mecha"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"}],"MediaType":"ONA","Status":"Currently Airing","NumEpisodes":6,"StartSeason":{"Year":2023,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":0,"Rating":null,"Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":0,"Completed":0,"OnHold":0,"Dropped":0,"PlanToWatch":2299},"NumListUsers":2299},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T19:59:02.96+02:00"},{"Id":54496,"Title":"\u0022Ai\u0022 wo Taberu","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1199/133411.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1199/133411l.jpg"},"StartDate":"2018","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2018,"Month":null,"Day":null},"EndDate":"2018","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2018,"Month":null,"Day":null},"Synopsis":"Graduate Work 2018 by Yuuta Watanabe, Tokyo Polytechnic University, Faculty of Arts, Department of Animation.","Mean":null,"Rank":17538,"Popularity":22636,"Genres":[{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"}],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":null,"Season":null},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":487,"Rating":"PG","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":3,"Completed":38,"OnHold":0,"Dropped":8,"PlanToWatch":11},"NumListUsers":60},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T19:59:04.001+02:00"},{"Id":54498,"Title":"Movin\u0027 feat.

Tang Yao, the guard of Baicheng, led his people to resist desperately, but they were outnumbered, and all sacrificed. Only the second daughter, Tang Ying, survived.\n\nWhat makes Tang Ying even more indignant is that his father sacrificed his life for the country, but in return he was charged with collaborating with the enemy. In order to take the place of her father, Tang Yingyi went to the capital, but found that things were not as simple as imagined.\n\nIs Yuan Lang, the second prince of the Daqi Kingdom who has been hostage for decades, related to Beiyi?\n\nWhy is the woman pretending to be herself so strangely similar?\n\nWhat happened to the otherworldly person that Yao Niang from the movie department was talking about?\n\nThere are also those strange and familiar memories that appeared nervously... There are too many mysteries waiting for Tang Ying to answer. \n\n(Source: Bilibili, Google translated)","Mean":6.8,"Rank":4979,"Popularity":14046,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"}],"MediaType":"ONA","Status":"Currently Airing","NumEpisodes":16,"StartSeason":{"Year":2023,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":0,"Rating":null,"Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":228,"Completed":0,"OnHold":42,"Dropped":59,"PlanToWatch":351},"NumListUsers":680},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T20:05:36.618+02:00"},{"Id":54883,"Title":"Mononogatari 2nd Season","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1111/135927.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1111/135927l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Jul 04 2023","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2023,"Month":7,"Day":4},"EndDate":null,"DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null},"Synopsis":"Second Season of Mononogatari","Mean":7.37,"Rank":2269,"Popularity":4649,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":50,"Name":"Adult Cast"},{"Id":6,"Name":"Mythology"},{"Id":42,"Name":"Seinen"},{"Id":37,"Name":"Supernatural"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Currently Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2023,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Tuesday","StartTime":"00:00"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1420,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":10223,"Completed":1,"OnHold":254,"Dropped":205,"PlanToWatch":9218},"NumListUsers":19901},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T20:05:38.69+02:00"},{"Id":54888,"Title":"Last Song","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1099/134857.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1099/134857l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Feb 22 2006","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2006,"Month":2,"Day":22},"EndDate":"Feb 22 2006","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2006,"Month":2,"Day":22},"Synopsis":"Music video for the song last song by Riddle.","Mean":null,"Rank":null,"Popularity":22715,"Genres":[{"Id":19,"Name":"Music"}],"MediaType":"Music","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2006,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":364,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":2,"Completed":47,"OnHold":1,"Dropped":4,"PlanToWatch":5},"NumListUsers":59},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T20:05:44.146+02:00"},{"Id":54889,"Title":"Titanium 2 Step feat.
