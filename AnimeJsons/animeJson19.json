To ensure humanity learns its lesson, a fleet of powerful warships equipped with advanced weaponry emerges, causing overwhelming defeat for naval forces throughout the world. Calling themselves the Fleet of Fog, each ship has a \u0022Mental Model,\u0022 a humanoid avatar which represents the ship\u0027s heart, its \u0022Union Core.\u0022 Each model has a different personality but all follow an unknown authority known as the Admiralty Code, who have implemented a blockade to prevent humans from traveling across the sea.\n \nSeventeen years after the blockade, Gunzou Chihaya, a National Marine Academy alumnus, stumbles upon I-401 and its Mental Model, Iona, who sides with mankind for unknown reasons. Utilizing this newfound hope of achieving peace for humanity, Gunzou and his friends form a group of privateers, known as the Blue Steel, as they set out on a dangerous journey.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.35,"Rank":2339,"Popularity":1461,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"},{"Id":42,"Name":"Seinen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2013,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Tuesday","StartTime":"02:55"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1460,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":6569,"Completed":85984,"OnHold":4284,"Dropped":6824,"PlanToWatch":44239},"NumListUsers":147900},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-08T12:38:01.336+02:00"},{"Id":18897,"Title":"Nisekoi","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/75587.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/75587l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Jan 11 2014","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2014,"Month":1,"Day":11},"EndDate":"May 24 2014","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2014,"Month":5,"Day":24},"Synopsis":"Raku Ichijou, a first-year student at Bonyari High School, is the sole heir to an intimidating yakuza family.
