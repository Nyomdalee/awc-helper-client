Hidden within the walls, they\u0027re told there\u0027s a key that will grant one wish, as well as a set of clues to find it. But there\u0027s a catch: the key must be found by the end of the school year and they must leave the premises by five o\u0027clock each day or else suffer a fatal end.\n\nAs time passes, a devastating truth emerges: only those brave enough to share their stories will be saved. And so they begin to unlock each other\u0027s stories: how a boy is showered with more gadgets than love; how another suffers a painful and unexplained rejection, and how a girl lives in fear of her predatory stepfather. As they struggle to abide by the rules of the game, a moving story unfolds, of seven characters trapped in a cycle of misunderstanding and loneliness, who are ultimately set free by the power of friendship, empathy, and sacrifice. \n\n(Source: Erewhon Books,

The men there were all hot-blooded and the women were all strong-willed. Their kingdom was called Qingyang.\n\nThe story is set in Qingyang and depicts the power struggles within the northern nomadic tribes, as well as the grievances between Qingyang and the East Land. As a child, the Qingyang crown prince L\u00FC Guichen was sent to live with the Yanzhen Tribe by the Great Lord. After the tribe rebelled, L\u00FC Guichen was brought back to Beidu city. However, his older brothers did not value this young and weak crown prince, instead focusing solely on competing against each other for the throne\u0027s succession. Yet, after experiencing the baptism of war and the ups and downs of life, L\u00FC Guichen, with his gentle personality, gradually matured and gained strength amidst his older brothers\u0027 power struggles...\n\nDuring that time, the royal family of the East Lands was in decline, and several feudal states had emerged. The Great Lord of Qingyang sought to use an alliance with the Xia Tang State to achieve his ambition of dominating the East. As a result, L\u00FC Guichen was sent as a hostage to Xia Tang. It was there that he met the unruly Tianqu warrior, Jiye, and was drawn to Jiye\u0027s tenacious and unyielding spirit, eventually becoming close friends. This is the story of the young Zhaowu Duke and the young Yulie King of the Xie Dynasty-to-be.","Mean":null,"Rank":20069,"Popularity":15468,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"}],"MediaType":"ONA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":13,"StartSeason":{"Year":2023,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Other","AverageEpisodeDuration":1219,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":107,"Completed":80,"OnHold":20,"Dropped":59,"PlanToWatch":196},"NumListUsers":462},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T19:03:09.159+02:00"},{"Id":51210,"Title":"Long Wang Dian 2nd Season","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1554/127542.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1554/127542l.jpg"},"StartDate":"2022","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2022,"Month":null,"Day":null},"EndDate":null,"DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null},"Synopsis":"","Mean":null,"Rank":15266,"Popularity":19930,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":35,"Name":"Harem"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"}],"MediaType":"ONA","Status":"Currently Airing","NumEpisodes":75,"StartSeason":{"Year":null,"Season":null},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Web Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":0,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":39,"Completed":0,"OnHold":8,"Dropped":30,"PlanToWatch":76},"NumListUsers":153},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T19:03:12.175+02:00"},{"Id":51211,"Title":"Go!

To protect themselves, the four kingdoms of the world established academies that train young people to become huntsmen: warriors tasked with destroying Grimm.\n\nIn the kingdom of Vale, the cheerful 15-year-old Ruby Rose has always dreamed of a life at the prestigious Beacon Academy. Sadly, being too young, she can only watch as her elder sister, Yang Xiao Long, sets off for the academy alone. But everything changes when Ruby fights off a group of armed robbers, and the news of her skillful exploit reaches Beacon\u0027s headmaster, Professor Ozpin.\n\nRuby is over the moon when she receives an invitation to join the academy alongside her sister. Meanwhile, halfway across the world in the kingdom of Atlas, corporate heiress Weiss Schnee defies her father\u0027s wish and sets off for Beacon, her heart brimming with anxious resolve. At the same time, lonesome rogue Blake Belladonna abandons her vigilante group in hopes of finding a better life at the academy. When their paths converge, the meeting between the four girls is anything but friendly. With vastly different personalities and beliefs, they often end up clashing. However, when they work together, team RWBY begins to create ripples across Beacon, the likes of which have never been seen before.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":6.35,"Rank":7467,"Popularity":1964,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2022,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Sunday","StartTime":"22:30"},"Source":"Other","AverageEpisodeDuration":1440,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":17393,"Completed":29906,"OnHold":4427,"Dropped":9699,"PlanToWatch":38573},"NumListUsers":99998},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T19:06:06.601+02:00"},{"Id":51382,"Title":"Hun Hou Richang","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1377/126047.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1377/126047l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Jul 31 2022","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2022,"Month":7,"Day":31},"EndDate":"Oct 09 2022","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2022,"Month":10,"Day":9},"Synopsis":"","Mean":null,"Rank":19752,"Popularity":19913,"Genres":[{"Id":36,"Name":"Slice of Life"}],"MediaType":"ONA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":24,"StartSeason":{"Year":2022,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":215,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":17,"Completed":27,"OnHold":7,"Dropped":47,"PlanToWatch":57},"NumListUsers":155},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T19:06:07.956+02:00"},{"Id":51383,"Title":"Wo Jian Qile Yi Di Shuxing","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1776/126821.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1776/126821l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Jan 23 2023","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2023,"Month":1,"Day":23},"EndDate":"Apr 24 2023","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2023,"Month":4,"Day":24},"Synopsis":"Feng Xia, a completely hardworking game player, travels through time and space.
