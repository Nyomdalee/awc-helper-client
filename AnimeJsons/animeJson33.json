This is the story of Closers in New Seoul.\nMysterious dimensional gates opened all over the planet and unleashed a worldwide invasion of dimensional monsters. No monsters and tactics had any effect on the waves of dimensional monsters pouring out of the dimensional gates. City after city was mercilessly destroyed.\n\nBut the opening of the dimensional gates did not only cause damage and destruction. The psychokinetic power that it awoke also enabled a tiny minority of humans to gain extraordinary psychic powers. With these psychic warriors, governments around the world were able to turn the tide of the war with these monsters. After unspeakable losses, the people of earth at least succeeded in closing the gates. Since they had closed the gates, these psychics began to be called \u0022CLOSERS,\u0022 and the invasion of the dimensional monsters was named the First Dimensional War.\n\nWith the dimensional monsters vanquished, peace returned to the world, and the cities were rebuilt. Through dedicated research into the dimensional gates and psychokinetic power, humans learned that the gates open when there is a singularity in this mysterious power. However, their understanding of the gates was still incomplete. The CLOSERS who survived the First Dimensional War became part of an organization called UNION.

With this power, Nene can temporarily master abilities and skills never seen before in the advancing world.\n\nWorking together, the two unlikely companions go on various missions\u2014from saving children in shopping mall fires to fighting reckless thieves\u2014all in the name of world peace. But to achieve this goal is not easy. B.U.E.R, a sentient laser in the form of a misshapen teddy bear, threatens to wreck their happy lives with his perverted nature and uncontrollable power. And to make matters worse, Nene\u0027s guardian, as well as genius inventor, Takumi Korobase has an undying interest in B.U.E.R.\n\nBurdened with saving the world and keeping B.U.E.R from the hands of evil, Nene and Clarion\u0027s desire for world peace seems like a pipe dream. With this monumental goal, could the weight of it all destroy the pair\u0027s friendship completely? \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":6.5,"Rank":6626,"Popularity":3110,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":9,"Name":"Ecchi"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2016,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Friday","StartTime":"23:00"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1440,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":3587,"Completed":18090,"OnHold":2237,"Dropped":5558,"PlanToWatch":15786},"NumListUsers":45258},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T12:57:55.028+02:00"},{"Id":32215,"Title":"High School DxD BorN: Yomigaeranai Fushichou","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1928/106618.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1928/106618l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Dec 09 2015","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2015,"Month":12,"Day":9},"EndDate":"Dec 09 2015","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2015,"Month":12,"Day":9},"Synopsis":"Unaired anime episode bundled with the limited edition of High School DxD DX.2.","Mean":7.42,"Rank":2055,"Popularity":1576,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":9,"Name":"Ecchi"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"},{"Id":35,"Name":"Harem"},{"Id":6,"Name":"Mythology"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"},{"Id":23,"Name":"School"}],"MediaType":"OVA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2015,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Light Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":1440,"Rating":"R\u002B","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":2720,"Completed":111181,"OnHold":949,"Dropped":713,"PlanToWatch":18939},"NumListUsers":134502},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T12:57:56.087+02:00"},{"Id":32218,"Title":"Choujikuu Seiki Orguss Memorial","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/78066.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/78066l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Mar 28 1985","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":1985,"Month":3,"Day":28},"EndDate":"May 28 1985","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":1985,"Month":5,"Day":28},"Synopsis":"Summary of The Super Dimension Century Orguss TV series.","Mean":null,"Rank":18418,"Popularity":14633,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":18,"Name":"Mecha"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"}],"MediaType":"OVA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":2,"StartSeason":{"Year":1985,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":3000,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":39,"Completed":185,"OnHold":15,"Dropped":71,"PlanToWatch":261},"NumListUsers":571},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T12:57:59.105+02:00"},{"Id":32219,"Title":"Raldessia Chronicles","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/77367.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/77367l.jpg"},"StartDate":"May 20 2013","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2013,"Month":5,"Day":20},"EndDate":"May 20 2013","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2013,"Month":5,"Day":20},"Synopsis":"DeNA\u0027s promotional anime video for its mobile game Raldessia Chronicles.\n","Mean":5.22,"Rank":11952,"Popularity":13703,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":19,"Name":"Music"}],"MediaType":"ONA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2013,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Game","AverageEpisodeDuration":46,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":37,"Completed":473,"OnHold":6,"Dropped":48,"PlanToWatch":197},"NumListUsers":761},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T12:58:00.15+02:00"},{"Id":32221,"Title":"Robocar Poli 2","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/78248.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/78248l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Dec 26 2011","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2011,"Month":12,"Day":26},"EndDate":"May 15 2012","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2012,"Month":5,"Day":15},"Synopsis":"In Broom\u0027s Town, a small town with a strong rescue team, there are always accidents and troubles such as a car sliding off a cliff in the rain, a car crash, a child locked in a firehouse and so on.

Claiming that she will die if he doesn\u0027t kiss someone within 24 hours, Guri\u0027s pleas of desperation are misunderstood as pleas for love, leading Seiji to kiss the cute stranger that came barging into his house. In actuality, it turns out that this cosplaying cupid is the wielder of a Kiss Note, in which any pairing of names she writes will kiss and become a couple. Guri explains that she misspelt and accidentally wrote Seiji\u0027s name while indulging in her yaoi fantasies, but because she had yet to pair him with anyone, their kiss was meaningless. Even worse, Guri reveals that if Seiji is not coupled with anyone soon, not only will she die, but Seiji will remain a virgin for eternity!\n\nEager to escape his fate, Seiji sets his sights on the beautiful and popular Akane Hiyama. But after Akane hears that he kissed Guri, she reveals the obsessive and psychopathic feelings that she holds for the unfortunate boy and proceeds to viciously attack them. In the ensuing confusion, Guri is able to pair Seiji with Akane in the Kiss Note, temporarily saving Seiji from any further bodily harm. But to complicate matters, Guri\u0027s newfound feelings lead her to also pair the two of them with herself. Just when the situation could not get any more convoluted, this new coupling with Guri has turned Seiji and Akane into temporary angels, forcing them into assisting the cupid with her work of pairing humans, lest they be cast into hell. With all semblance of normality snatched from his life, Seiji gets to work at matchmaking with these eccentric girls by his side.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":6.62,"Rank":5939,"Popularity":617,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":9,"Name":"Ecchi"},{"Id":35,"Name":"Harem"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"},{"Id":23,"Name":"School"},{"Id":37,"Name":"Supernatural"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2017,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Friday","StartTime":"02:35"},"Source":"Web Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1430,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":25523,"Completed":224625,"OnHold":9682,"Dropped":23501,"PlanToWatch":74255},"NumListUsers":357586},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T12:58:44.293+02:00"},{"Id":32264,"Title":"Dear Brave","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1476/112414.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1476/112414l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Nov 18 2015","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2015,"Month":11,"Day":18},"EndDate":"Nov 18 2015","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2015,"Month":11,"Day":18},"Synopsis":"","Mean":6.23,"Rank":null,"Popularity":11041,"Genres":[{"Id":19,"Name":"Music"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"}],"MediaType":"Music","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2015,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":262,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":54,"Completed":1266,"OnHold":25,"Dropped":65,"PlanToWatch":423},"NumListUsers":1833},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T12:58:46.04+02:00"},{"Id":32267,"Title":"Kowaremono: Risa The Animation","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1368/104163.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1368/104163l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Jan 01 2016","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2016,"Month":1,"Day":1},"EndDate":"Jan 01 2016","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2016,"Month":1,"Day":1},"Synopsis":"Risa runs away from her home, and her uncle\u0027s house is the only place she can go to.

No longer facing humanity\u0027s extinction, the children are awakened from their slumber. It is then discovered that, while in cryogenesis, the children had developed Worlds, supernatural powers unique to each person. The six most powerful children are given command of the reclaimed cities, using their powers to defend the strongholds against the continuing invasion. Childhood friends Ichiya Suzaku and Canaria Utara lead Tokyo, siblings Kasumi and Asuha Chigusa manage Chiba, and Maihime Tenkawa and Hotaru Rindou oversee Kanagawa.\n\nOver time, the almost routine attacks from the Unknown and the clashing personalities of the city heads and subheads cultivate petty rivalries, leading to constant arguments between the three cities. With the Unknown suddenly increasing the pressure of their attacks, the three cities\u0027 leaders must learn how to work together or risk losing the last line of defense against humanity\u0027s extinction.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":6.47,"Rank":6787,"Popularity":1184,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"},{"Id":31,"Name":"Super Power"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2016,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Sunday","StartTime":"00:00"},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":1420,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":14449,"Completed":93821,"OnHold":5485,"Dropped":12518,"PlanToWatch":62722},"NumListUsers":188995},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T13:00:24.226+02:00"},{"Id":32365,"Title":"Boruto: Naruto the Movie - Naruto ga Hokage ni Natta Hi","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/77678.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/77678l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Jul 06 2016","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2016,"Month":7,"Day":6},"EndDate":"Jul 06 2016","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2016,"Month":7,"Day":6},"Synopsis":"Bundled with the limited edition of Blu-ray/DVD of Boruto: Naruto the Movie.","Mean":7.33,"Rank":2441,"Popularity":1838,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"},{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"}],"MediaType":"Special","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2016,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":628,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":1619,"Completed":94868,"OnHold":490,"Dropped":605,"PlanToWatch":12647},"NumListUsers":110229},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T13:00:29.028+02:00"},{"Id":32366,"Title":"Gintama\u00B0: Aizome Kaori-hen","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1962/133573.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1962/133573l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Aug 04 2016","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2016,"Month":8,"Day":4},"EndDate":"Nov 04 2016","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2016,"Month":11,"Day":4},"Synopsis":"The red-light district, Yoshiwara, is suddenly taken over by \u0022Aizen Kou,\u0022 an incense that has the ability to make anyone fall in love with the first person they see.
