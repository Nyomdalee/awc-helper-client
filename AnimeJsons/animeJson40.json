Frightened, all the animals fled their homes and ran out of the forest. As they came to the edge of a stream they stopped to watch the fire and they were feeling very discouraged and powerless. They were all bemoaning the destruction of their homes. Every one of them thought there was nothing they could do about the fire, except for one little hummingbird.\n\nThis particular hummingbird decided it would do something. It swooped into the stream and picked up a few drops of water and went into the forest and put them on the fire. Then it went back to the stream and did it again, and it kept going back, again and again and again. All the other animals watched in disbelief; some tried to discourage the hummingbird with comments like, \u0022Don\u0027t bother, it is too much, you are too little, your wings will burn, your beak is too tiny, it\u2019s only a drop, you can\u0027t put out this fire.\u0022\n\nAnd as the animals stood around disparaging the little bird\u2019s efforts, the bird noticed how hopeless and forlorn they looked. Then one of the animals shouted out and challenged the hummingbird in a mocking voice, \u0022What do you think you are doing?\u0022 And the hummingbird, without wasting time or losing a beat, looked back and said, \u0022I am doing what I can.\u0022\n\n(Source: sechangersoi.be)","Mean":null,"Rank":19357,"Popularity":20644,"Genres":[{"Id":15,"Name":"Kids"}],"MediaType":"OVA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":null,"Season":null},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Other","AverageEpisodeDuration":1140,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":10,"Completed":27,"OnHold":2,"Dropped":38,"PlanToWatch":34},"NumListUsers":111},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T14:55:49.087+02:00"},{"Id":39148,"Title":"Mottainai","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1415/98615.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1415/98615l.jpg"},"StartDate":"2005","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2005,"Month":null,"Day":null},"EndDate":"2005","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2005,"Month":null,"Day":null},"Synopsis":"An educational anime about environmental waste aimed at promoting recycling to children.","Mean":null,"Rank":15792,"Popularity":20513,"Genres":[{"Id":15,"Name":"Kids"}],"MediaType":"OVA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":null,"Season":null},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":1320,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":8,"Completed":33,"OnHold":3,"Dropped":35,"PlanToWatch":39},"NumListUsers":118},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T14:55:49.795+02:00"},{"Id":39149,"Title":"Ushiwakamaru","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1355/98644.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1355/98644l.jpg"},"StartDate":null,"DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null},"EndDate":null,"DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null},"Synopsis":"A time-slipped Ushiwakamaru (the childhood name of Minamoto no Yoshitsune, a military commander of the Minamoto clan and is known as one of the strongest samurai in the history of Japan) arrives in modern day Japan and has to learn traffic safety, bicycle traffic safety, disaster prevention, and kidnapping prevention.","Mean":null,"Rank":13538,"Popularity":20721,"Genres":[{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"},{"Id":15,"Name":"Kids"}],"MediaType":"OVA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":4,"StartSeason":{"Year":null,"Season":null},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":720,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":9,"Completed":24,"OnHold":4,"Dropped":36,"PlanToWatch":34},"NumListUsers":107},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T14:55:50.809+02:00"},{"Id":39150,"Title":"Otogi","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1547/98672.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1547/98672l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Feb 06 2019","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2019,"Month":2,"Day":6},"EndDate":"Feb 06 2019","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2019,"Month":2,"Day":6},"Synopsis":"Eve\u0027s first press limited edition release of their Otogi album CD includes an accompanying DVD.

As they continue their adventures, they explore the world, meet new people, and will perhaps uncover the mysteries behind Yuuki\u0027s missing memories.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n","Mean":7.05,"Rank":3860,"Popularity":829,"Genres":[{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"},{"Id":47,"Name":"Gourmet"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":13,"StartSeason":{"Year":2020,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Tuesday","StartTime":"00:30"},"Source":"Game","AverageEpisodeDuration":1420,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":31460,"Completed":135771,"OnHold":11609,"Dropped":18728,"PlanToWatch":77122},"NumListUsers":274690},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T14:58:17.588+02:00"},{"Id":39293,"Title":"Let\u0027s\u2606Cookin\u0027 Jam","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1934/99111.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1934/99111l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Mar 16 2008","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2008,"Month":3,"Day":16},"EndDate":"Mar 16 2008","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2008,"Month":3,"Day":16},"Synopsis":"Short animation by Takashi Ohashi, featuring music he composed to go accompany the work.","Mean":5.42,"Rank":null,"Popularity":18376,"Genres":[{"Id":19,"Name":"Music"}],"MediaType":"Music","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2008,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":126,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":8,"Completed":186,"OnHold":1,"Dropped":17,"PlanToWatch":31},"NumListUsers":243},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T14:58:17.893+02:00"},{"Id":39294,"Title":"Study","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1636/99112.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1636/99112l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Oct 28 2008","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2008,"Month":10,"Day":28},"EndDate":"Oct 28 2008","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2008,"Month":10,"Day":28},"Synopsis":"Short animation directed by Takashi Ohashi, featuring the song Delight by Haruka Nakamura from his album \u0022Afterglow.\u0022","Mean":5.44,"Rank":null,"Popularity":18298,"Genres":[{"Id":19,"Name":"Music"}],"MediaType":"Music","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2008,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":171,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":9,"Completed":186,"OnHold":0,"Dropped":14,"PlanToWatch":39},"NumListUsers":248},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T14:58:18.692+02:00"},{"Id":39295,"Title":"Hikaru no Go: Memories","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1264/99114.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1264/99114l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Jun 30 2004","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2004,"Month":6,"Day":30},"EndDate":"Jun 30 2004","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2004,"Month":6,"Day":30},"Synopsis":"Recap of Hikaru no Go included in the \u0022Special Character DVD ~Memories~\u0022 disc.

This is the handiwork of eight-hundred-year-old nun Yaobikuni, who placed bloodworms capable of healing almost any wound in Manji\u0027s body.\n\nTo atone for his crimes, Manji resolves to kill one thousand evil men. Yaobikuni agrees to this proposal, saying that if he succeeds, she will undo his curse of immortality. Soon after this promise, Manji meets Rin Asano, a 16-year-old girl who requests Manji\u0027s assistance in killing those who slaughtered her parents.\n\nInitially reluctant, Manji refuses Rin\u0027s desperate plea. However, owing to her evident lack of strength, Manji changes his mind and agrees to protect Rin for four years. With this partnership set in stone, the two embark on a perilous journey of bloodshed, vengeance, and redemption, each to fulfill their own life\u0027s cause.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.42,"Rank":2065,"Popularity":2284,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"},{"Id":17,"Name":"Martial Arts"},{"Id":21,"Name":"Samurai"},{"Id":42,"Name":"Seinen"},{"Id":37,"Name":"Supernatural"}],"MediaType":"ONA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":24,"StartSeason":{"Year":2019,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1434,"Rating":"R","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":9831,"Completed":26236,"OnHold":5037,"Dropped":7012,"PlanToWatch":30332},"NumListUsers":78448},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T15:07:00.912+02:00"},{"Id":39808,"Title":"Non Non Biyori Nonstop","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1033/111540.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1033/111540l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Jan 11 2021","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2021,"Month":1,"Day":11},"EndDate":"Mar 29 2021","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2021,"Month":3,"Day":29},"Synopsis":"The carefree journeys of the four girls continue!
