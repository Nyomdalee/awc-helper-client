However, he felt sorry about what he was doing and hid her under the earthen floor of a barn. One day, a messenger of the lord of the neighboring province was sent to the lord of Shinano Province making an unreasonable demand that a silk thread be threaded through a winding hole in a crystal ball and threatened that force would be used unless the task was done. The devoted son consulted with his mother, and she taught him a method in which you put honey around the end of one hole and let an ant tied with a thread go through it from the other end. The lord rewarded the son. However, a messenger was sent from the neighboring province again demanding that they identify which of two identical mares is the parent and which is the child. The son asked his mother again and then told the solution to the lord. When told by the lord that he would grant the son\u2019s wish, he pleaded for his mother\u2019s life.

To combat them, an organization named Fenrir was formed as a last-ditch effort to save humanity through the use of \u0022God Eaters\u0022\u2014special humans infused with Oracle cells, allowing them to wield the God Arc, the only known weapon capable of killing an Aragami. One such God Eater is Lenka Utsugi, a New-Type whose God Arc takes the form of both blade and gun.\n\nNow, as one of Fenrir\u0027s greatest weapons, Lenka must master his God Arc if he is to fulfill his desire of wiping out the Aragami once and for all. The monsters continue to be born en masse while the remnants of humanity struggle to survive the night. Only God Eaters stand between the Aragami and complete and total annihilation of the human race.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.2,"Rank":3105,"Popularity":387,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"},{"Id":38,"Name":"Military"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":13,"StartSeason":{"Year":2015,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Sunday","StartTime":"22:30"},"Source":"Game","AverageEpisodeDuration":1435,"Rating":"R","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":38737,"Completed":309759,"OnHold":18723,"Dropped":37105,"PlanToWatch":130221},"NumListUsers":534545},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T00:11:18.747+02:00"},{"Id":27633,"Title":"Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun Specials","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/66871.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/66871l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Sep 24 2014","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2014,"Month":9,"Day":24},"EndDate":"Feb 25 2015","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2015,"Month":2,"Day":25},"Synopsis":"Specials bundled with the Blu-ray/DVDs.","Mean":7.71,"Rank":1137,"Popularity":1572,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"},{"Id":23,"Name":"School"}],"MediaType":"Special","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":6,"StartSeason":{"Year":2014,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"4-koma Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":180,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":4106,"Completed":106756,"OnHold":2044,"Dropped":1022,"PlanToWatch":20727},"NumListUsers":134655},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T00:11:20.791+02:00"},{"Id":27651,"Title":"Ginga Tetsudou 999: Niji no Michishirube","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/66929.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/66929l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Jul 04 2001","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2001,"Month":7,"Day":4},"EndDate":"Jul 04 2001","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2001,"Month":7,"Day":4},"Synopsis":"Short movie screened at the 2001 Kitakyushu Expo-Festival held in Kitakyushu City, Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan.","Mean":6.07,"Rank":8959,"Popularity":13231,"Genres":[{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"}],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2001,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Unknown","AverageEpisodeDuration":1035,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":42,"Completed":278,"OnHold":39,"Dropped":72,"PlanToWatch":440},"NumListUsers":871},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T00:11:39.159+02:00"},{"Id":27653,"Title":"Crayon Shin-chan Movie 23: Ora no Hikkoshi Monogatari - Saboten Daisuugeki","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1584/94871.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1584/94871l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Apr 18 2015","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2015,"Month":4,"Day":18},"EndDate":"Apr 18 2015","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2015,"Month":4,"Day":18},"Synopsis":"Hiroshi was ordered to be the manager of his company\u0027s Mexico branch in order to collect the fruit of a new type of cactus that has the sweetest nectar.

While conducting training exercises 80 miles off Okinawa, an A4 strike aircraft is loaded with a B43 hydrogen bomb, but it falls overboard and sinks in 16,000 feet of water. Based on the true story of the USS Ticonderoga, which reached Japan two days later (on the anniversary of Pearl Harbor; nice touch). Neither side revealed the incident, nor that she was carrying atomic weapons in contravention of U.S. treaties with Japan. The plane, its pilot, and the bomb were never recovered, and the incident was only declassified in 1989, causing an outcry in Japan and resulting in this environmentally themed anime. The extra \u0022n\u0022 in Ticonderonga may be a genuine error in transcription or an attempt to distance the story from real events, since the anime continues with Ashika, a boy from a Japanese fishing town, contacted by telepathic whales who bring him visions of fearful seamonsters. Then again, if you were a whale given a choice between nuclear contamination and talking to Japanese fishermen, which would you choose?\n\n(Source: The Anime Encyclopedia)","Mean":null,"Rank":13264,"Popularity":18750,"Genres":[{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"},{"Id":15,"Name":"Kids"}],"MediaType":"OVA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":null,"Season":null},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Unknown","AverageEpisodeDuration":1680,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":16,"Completed":45,"OnHold":4,"Dropped":57,"PlanToWatch":98},"NumListUsers":220},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T00:14:50.975+02:00"},{"Id":27841,"Title":"Karasu no Panya-san/Dorobou Gakkou","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/67457.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/67457l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Sep 11 1998","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":1998,"Month":9,"Day":11},"EndDate":"Sep 11 1998","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":1998,"Month":9,"Day":11},"Synopsis":"A double feature based on a best-selling children\u0027s books by Satoshi Hako.\n\nKarasu no Panya-san is about a crow bakery in the forest run by a couple and their children.\n\nDorobou Gakkou is about the self-explanatory goings-on at an educational institute with a difference.\n\n(Source: The Anime Encyclopedia)\n","Mean":null,"Rank":17430,"Popularity":18811,"Genres":[{"Id":15,"Name":"Kids"}],"MediaType":"OVA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":2,"StartSeason":{"Year":1998,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Unknown","AverageEpisodeDuration":1200,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":15,"Completed":62,"OnHold":8,"Dropped":62,"PlanToWatch":69},"NumListUsers":216},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T00:14:52.959+02:00"},{"Id":27843,"Title":"Nemurenu Yoru no Chiisana Ohanashi","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/67459.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/67459l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Apr 24 1992","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":1992,"Month":4,"Day":24},"EndDate":"Oct 23 1992","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":1992,"Month":10,"Day":23},"Synopsis":"Three videos about cats--Cat\u0027s Best Friend, Cat\u0027s Adventure, and Cat\u0027s Christmas-each containing three smaller stories of feline fun.
