The Symphonic Poem originated with the music Isao Tomita wrote for Jungle Emperor in 1965. He re-worked his music into a long form which tells a story by itself. (This form of music was termed \u0022symphonic poem\u0022 or \u0022tone poem\u0022 by composers in the late Romantic era.) So music that was written originally to enhance visual story telling became the story teller.\n\nTomita\u0027s symphonic poem was recorded in the mid-60s and issued on LP in Japan. More than once, in fact. It has also been on CD more than once.\n\nIn 1991, Tezuka Productions turned the process upside down and created new animation to illustrate the symphonic poem. The story is basically that of the first Kimba episode. We see the peaceful animal kingdom under Panja, the coming of the hunters, Eliza\u0027s capture and Panja\u0027s death. Kimba is born and escapes back to Africa. All this told without a single word spoken. The style of the Symphonic Poem\u0027s animation is unique. It draws heavily on the style of the 1989 TV series, but Kimba looks different from the way he looked in any other production.\n\n(Source: kimbawlion.com)","Mean":6.47,"Rank":6749,"Popularity":12224,"Genres":[{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":15,"Name":"Kids"},{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"}],"MediaType":"OVA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":1991,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":3060,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":46,"Completed":619,"OnHold":32,"Dropped":97,"PlanToWatch":397},"NumListUsers":1191},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-10T00:51:35.577+02:00"},{"Id":13051,"Title":"Bishoujo Animerama: Miyuki-chan SOS-H Shichauzo","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/36657.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/36657l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Aug 24 1989","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":1989,"Month":8,"Day":24},"EndDate":"Aug 24 1989","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":1989,"Month":8,"Day":24},"Synopsis":"A mix of animation and live-action.

Ibuki seems to be spared by grief, but this new lifestyle only makes him nothing more than a dog to one of the most influential men in all of Kyoto.\n\nMeanwhile, with the rise of ronin attacks on the general population, the shogunate sends the Roshigumi to Kyoto to strike for peace. Led by the honorable yet soft-spoken Isami Kondou, the Roshigumi is composed of strong and skilled samurai but lacks any meaningful political connections to gain footing in the city plagued by crime. Having no other choice, Kondou allies with the arrogant Serizawa and his connections in exchange for their combative strength.\n\nDespite hating everything the samurai stand for, Ibuki finds himself tangled in the business of the Roshigumi. However, as he interacts with the members under Kondou\u0027s leadership, Ibuki slowly realizes that not all samurai are as cruel and dishonorable as he once thought.

In the 22nd century, Japan enforces the Sibyl System, an objective means of determining the threat level of each citizen by examining their mental state for signs of criminal intent, known as their Psycho-Pass. Inspectors uphold the law by subjugating, often with lethal force, anyone harboring the slightest ill-will; alongside them are Enforcers, jaded Inspectors that have become latent criminals, granted relative freedom in exchange for carrying out the Inspectors\u0027 dirty work.\n\nInto this world steps Akane Tsunemori, a young woman with an honest desire to uphold justice. However, as she works alongside veteran Enforcer Shinya Kougami, she soon learns that the Sibyl System\u0027s judgments are not as perfect as her fellow Inspectors assume. With everything she has known turned on its head, Akane wrestles with the question of what justice truly is, and whether it can be upheld through the use of a system that may already be corrupt.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":8.34,"Rank":217,"Popularity":61,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":50,"Name":"Adult Cast"},{"Id":39,"Name":"Detective"},{"Id":7,"Name":"Mystery"},{"Id":40,"Name":"Psychological"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"},{"Id":41,"Name":"Suspense"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":22,"StartSeason":{"Year":2012,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Friday","StartTime":"00:45"},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":1380,"Rating":"R","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":106412,"Completed":910946,"OnHold":70110,"Dropped":50860,"PlanToWatch":442371},"NumListUsers":1580699},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-07T20:44:09.756+02:00"},{"Id":13619,"Title":"Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei Special Omake","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/37831.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/37831l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Jan 31 2012","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2012,"Month":1,"Day":31},"EndDate":"Jan 31 2012","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2012,"Month":1,"Day":31},"Synopsis":"A special short in BD BOX.","Mean":6.58,"Rank":6163,"Popularity":7196,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":20,"Name":"Parody"},{"Id":23,"Name":"School"}],"MediaType":"Special","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2012,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":60,"Rating":"R","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":146,"Completed":3761,"OnHold":118,"Dropped":114,"PlanToWatch":2520},"NumListUsers":6659},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-07T20:44:28.113+02:00"},{"Id":13629,"Title":"Furiko","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/68985.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/68985l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Mar 16 2012","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2012,"Month":3,"Day":16},"EndDate":"Mar 16 2012","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2012,"Month":3,"Day":16},"Synopsis":"Furiko, meaning \u0022pendulum,\u0022 shows the highs and lows of a family of two\u2014a high schooler, and his future wife, whom he rescues from delinquents.
