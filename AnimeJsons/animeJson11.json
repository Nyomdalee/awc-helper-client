In addition to this, the robot destroys herself to protect the established solar power generation system in space. \n\nThe unsuccessful outcome of the competition for Tezuka Osamu was only natural, and it is clear that he created this piece, as it was intentionally, as he managed everything from the original story to the screenplay, animation, narration, etc., all the while knowing that the competition was sponsored by a power company. \n\n(Source: tezukaosamu.net)","Mean":5.11,"Rank":12145,"Popularity":14409,"Genres":[{"Id":18,"Name":"Mecha"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"}],"MediaType":"Special","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":1987,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Unknown","AverageEpisodeDuration":377,"Rating":null,"Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":34,"Completed":247,"OnHold":14,"Dropped":80,"PlanToWatch":235},"NumListUsers":610},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-10T00:36:55.446+02:00"},{"Id":10045,"Title":"Seishun Fuufu Monogatari: Koiko no Mainichi","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/28050.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/28050l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Sep 22 1989","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":1989,"Month":9,"Day":22},"EndDate":"Mar 23 1990","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":1990,"Month":3,"Day":23},"Synopsis":"Based on the romance manga \u0022Koiko no Mainichi \u0022 by George Akiyama, serialized in Weekly Manga Goraku.\n\nIn a story that flits between serious drama and comedic farce, Shinjuku gangster Sabu and his young wife Koiko try to live a normal life, despite the interferences of gang politics and criminal deals.

The Phoenix chooses a story entitled \u0022Old Woman\u0022 (\u0022Oba-chan\u0022) from numerous episodes of \u0022Black Jack\u0022 to discuss the theme of how much love can grow in this short lifetime. In the story, there is a seemingly greedy old woman who is always asking her daughter-in-law for money, and her son and his wife become fed up with the old woman\u0027s behaviour. Naturally, there are constant quarrels in the family, and their quiet ordinary life seems to have been lost. \n\nAfter accidentally coming to know the family, Black Jack learns that the old woman had her young son, who was dying at the time, treated and saved by a noted doctor who claimed a great amount of money. She has, in fact, been paying for the treatment over some tens of years. Because of her great love for her son, the old woman devoted her entire life to paying for the treatment. \n\nNot aware of his mother\u0027s act, the son feels helplessly hammered and squeezed by his mother and his wife. But when he finally comes to know the truth, he is deeply impressed with the love of his mother, who valued her son\u0027s life more than her own. Black Jack asks him if he could love her just as much as she loved him. Explaining that only love valued more highly than life can live forever, the Phoenix then tells a story about the move of the capital to Heian, which was a great national project and an attempt to infuse a city with eternal life.\n\n(Source: official site)","Mean":6.36,"Rank":7401,"Popularity":9967,"Genres":[{"Id":67,"Name":"Medical"},{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"}],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":null,"Season":null},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":600,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":74,"Completed":1364,"OnHold":56,"Dropped":93,"PlanToWatch":1010},"NumListUsers":2597},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-10T00:37:00.912+02:00"},{"Id":10056,"Title":"Sore Ike!

One day, while walking on the street, he stumbles upon Yuuji Endou, who is hunting Kaiji due to the money he owes to the Teiai Group. Unaware of this, Kaiji eagerly follows Endou, hoping for a chance to participate in another gamble, but soon finds out the loan shark\u0027s real intentions when he is kidnapped.\n\nGiven that Kaiji is unable to pay off his huge debt, the Teiai Group instead sends him to work in an underground labor camp. He is told that he will have to live in this hell for 15 years, alongside other debtors, until he can earn his freedom. His only hope to put an early end to this nightmare is by saving enough money to be able to go back to the surface for a single day. Once he is there, he plans to obtain the remaining money needed to settle his account by making a high-stakes wager. However, as many temptations threaten his scarce income, Kaiji may have to resort to gambling sooner than he had expected.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":8.25,"Rank":298,"Popularity":1193,"Genres":[{"Id":50,"Name":"Adult Cast"},{"Id":59,"Name":"High Stakes Game"},{"Id":40,"Name":"Psychological"},{"Id":42,"Name":"Seinen"},{"Id":11,"Name":"Strategy Game"},{"Id":41,"Name":"Suspense"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":26,"StartSeason":{"Year":2011,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Wednesday","StartTime":"00:59"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1440,"Rating":"R","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":7405,"Completed":123756,"OnHold":4365,"Dropped":2702,"PlanToWatch":49058},"NumListUsers":187286},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-10T00:38:44.198+02:00"},{"Id":10276,"Title":"Tennis no Oujisama: Mini Theater","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/28332.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/28332l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Dec 22 2009","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2009,"Month":12,"Day":22},"EndDate":"Dec 22 2009","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2009,"Month":12,"Day":22},"Synopsis":"Mini Theater 1\nSeishun Academy faces off against Rikkai University-Affiliated Middle School in an unofficial rematch.

Its chances of getting a proper release are slim, as Shinkai intended it only as practice using 3DCG programs. \n\n(Source: AniDB)","Mean":5.12,"Rank":12128,"Popularity":10716,"Genres":[{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"}],"MediaType":"ONA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":null,"Season":null},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":30,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":66,"Completed":1006,"OnHold":43,"Dropped":77,"PlanToWatch":861},"NumListUsers":2053},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-10T00:39:20.631+02:00"},{"Id":10355,"Title":"Twinkle Heart: Gingakei made Todokanai","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/28457.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/28457l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Dec 05 1986","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":1986,"Month":12,"Day":5},"EndDate":"Dec 05 1986","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":1986,"Month":12,"Day":5},"Synopsis":"Love, Heaven\u0027s greatest treasure went missing and to get it back, the Great God decides to send his two daughters Lemon and Cherry, as well as their governess Berry to find it.

This might not seem like an ability that could exert power over a land, but in Manyuu Hikenchou, large breasts denote status, wealth, fame, and influence.\n\nGrave concern has arisen in the Manyuu clan due to the actions of their chosen successor, Chifusa. Disgusted with the breast obsessed society that the Manyuu have created and perpetuated, Chifusa has not only deserted the clan, but also stolen the sacred scroll that details their techniques to growing and severing breasts.\n\nFortunately, Chifusa is not completely alone. Her fellow warrior Kaede is sympathetic to her cause; a sympathy that could place her in considerable danger. Now wanted by the very clan that raised her, Chifusa must defend her life and Kaede\u0027s while seeking to undo the damage their brethren have done to the land.
