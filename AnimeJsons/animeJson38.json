It\u0027s a savage sport where the strongest survive, and anyone willing to test their mettle can step into the ring. There is, however, a minimum size requirement to be a pro sumo wrestler, and young Hinomaru Ushio, incredibly talented and hardworking though he may be, does not meet that requirement. This small boy has big dreams of reaching the highest class of  sumo, Hinoshita Kaisan. The only way he could possibly go pro is if he becomes the High School Yokozuna, a title given to the strongest wrestler in high school tournaments.\n\nUshio is under a lot of pressure, as well as a time limit. If he can\u0027t show off his skills in the high school tournaments, he may lose his chance to go pro permanently, and the odds are stacked against him. Instead of enrolling in Ishigami High, the best school for sumo in Japan, he enrolls in Odachi High and must build a sumo club from the ground up with the one devout member Shinya Ozeki. Odachi High is the true underdog of the sumo world, but Ushio has to push forward with all his strength if he is going to make it professionally.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n","Mean":7.55,"Rank":1577,"Popularity":1747,"Genres":[{"Id":54,"Name":"Combat Sports"},{"Id":23,"Name":"School"},{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"},{"Id":30,"Name":"Sports"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":24,"StartSeason":{"Year":2018,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Friday","StartTime":"22:00"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1410,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":12328,"Completed":63116,"OnHold":5037,"Dropped":8192,"PlanToWatch":29430},"NumListUsers":118103},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T14:19:23.884+02:00"},{"Id":37008,"Title":"Tsukipro The Animation 2","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1651/116291.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1651/116291l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Jul 07 2021","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2021,"Month":7,"Day":7},"EndDate":"Dec 29 2021","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2021,"Month":12,"Day":29},"Synopsis":"For the members of SolidS, Growth, SOARA, and QUELL, the Tsukino Talent Productions\u0027 Live 2021 Summer Carnival is coming soon.

Unprepared and inexperienced, the group soon faces its inevitable demise from an ambush while exploring a cave. With no one else left standing, the terrified Priestess accepts her fate\u2014until the Goblin Slayer unexpectedly appears to not only rescue her with little effort, but destroy the entire goblin nest. \n\nAs a holder of the prestigious Silver rank, the Goblin Slayer allows her to accompany him as he assists the Adventurer\u0027s Guild in all goblin-related matters. Together with the Priestess, High Elf, Dwarf, and Lizardman, the armored warrior will not rest until every single goblin in the frontier lands has been eradicated for good.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.42,"Rank":2052,"Popularity":133,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"},{"Id":58,"Name":"Gore"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2018,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Sunday","StartTime":"00:30"},"Source":"Light Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":1420,"Rating":"R","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":69309,"Completed":774472,"OnHold":24095,"Dropped":54493,"PlanToWatch":138258},"NumListUsers":1060627},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T14:25:13.029+02:00"},{"Id":37350,"Title":"Obake de Ii kara Hayaku Kite","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1542/90663.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1542/90663l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Feb 01 2018","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2018,"Month":2,"Day":1},"EndDate":"Feb 01 2018","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2018,"Month":2,"Day":1},"Synopsis":"A metaphorical expression of a child who got separated from their mother at a department store and is overwhelmed by the anxiety with having to seek a stranger for help (and the experience of being in the security room for lost children).","Mean":5.54,"Rank":null,"Popularity":18253,"Genres":[{"Id":15,"Name":"Kids"},{"Id":19,"Name":"Music"}],"MediaType":"Music","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2018,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":145,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":15,"Completed":164,"OnHold":1,"Dropped":25,"PlanToWatch":45},"NumListUsers":250},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T14:25:14.089+02:00"},{"Id":37351,"Title":"Ten made Tobaso","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1876/90664.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1876/90664l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Feb 01 2018","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2018,"Month":2,"Day":1},"EndDate":"Feb 01 2018","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2018,"Month":2,"Day":1},"Synopsis":"A little girl astronaut crashes her small ship out in space.

Mankind has lost the battle for planet Earth to Godzilla, and has taken to the stars in search of a new home. But the search ends in vain, forcing them and their alien allies back to Earth. But 20,000 years have passed in their absence, and the Earth is a wholly different place.\n\nThe planet\u0027s flora and fauna now embody and serve Godzilla. Earth is a monster\u0027s planet, ruled by the largest Godzilla ever at 300 meters in height. Godzilla Earth.\n\nHuman protagonist, Captain Haruo, yearns to defeat Godzilla and retake the planet for mankind. There, he meets aboriginal descendants of the human race, the Houtua tribe. The Houtua twin sisters, Maina and Miana, lead him to the skeletal remains of Mecha-Godzilla, an old anti-Godzilla weapon, which to everyone\u0027s surprise is still alive in the form of self-generating nanometal. Taken from the Mecha-Godzilla carcass, the nanometals have gradually been rebuilding a \u0022Mecha-Godzilla City,\u0022 a potential weapon capable of destroying Godzilla Earth.\n\nAs the strategy develops, a rift forms between the humans and the Bilusaludo, one of several alien races that had joined the humans on their exodus from Earth. Their leader, Galu-gu, believes that the secret to defeating Godzilla lies in the use of superhuman powers \u2013 namely, the nanometal integration \u2013 but Haruo resists, fearing that in defeating monsters, they must not become monsters themselves. Haruo ultimately uses his means for defeating Godzilla Earth to destroy the Mecha-Godzilla city so as to prevent nanometal assimilation, killing Galu-gu. However, his childhood friend, Yuuko, has been absorbed by the nanometal integration and has fallen into a brain dead coma.\n\nThe human race, once again, is lost. Metphies, commander of the priestly alien race, Exif, marvels at the miraculous survival of Haruo, he begins to attract a following. The Exif has secretly harbored this outcome as their \u0022ultimate goal.\u0022 Miana and Maina issue warnings against Metphies, while Haruo begins to question mankind\u0027s next move.\n\nWith no means for defeating Godzilla Earth, mankind watches as King Ghidorah, clad in a golden light, descends on the planet. The earth shakes once again with as war moves to a higher dimension.\n\nWhat is Godzilla exactly? Does mankind stand a chance? Is there a future vision in Haruo\u0027s eyes?
