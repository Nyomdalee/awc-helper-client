It\u0027s a savage sport where the strongest survive, and anyone willing to test their mettle can step into the ring. There is, however, a minimum size requirement to be a pro sumo wrestler, and young Hinomaru Ushio, incredibly talented and hardworking though he may be, does not meet that requirement. This small boy has big dreams of reaching the highest class of  sumo, Hinoshita Kaisan. The only way he could possibly go pro is if he becomes the High School Yokozuna, a title given to the strongest wrestler in high school tournaments.\n\nUshio is under a lot of pressure, as well as a time limit. If he can\u0027t show off his skills in the high school tournaments, he may lose his chance to go pro permanently, and the odds are stacked against him. Instead of enrolling in Ishigami High, the best school for sumo in Japan, he enrolls in Odachi High and must build a sumo club from the ground up with the one devout member Shinya Ozeki. Odachi High is the true underdog of the sumo world, but Ushio has to push forward with all his strength if he is going to make it professionally.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n","Mean":7.55,"Rank":1604,"Popularity":1749,"Genres":[{"Id":30,"Name":"Sports"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":54,"Name":"Combat Sports"},{"Id":23,"Name":"School"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":24,"StartSeason":{"Year":2018,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Friday","StartTime":"22:00"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1410,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":12355,"Completed":63335,"OnHold":5051,"Dropped":8210,"PlanToWatch":29486,"Total":118437},"Favorites":341,"Producers":["Nihon Ad Systems","Pony Canyon","Shueisha","BS11","Jinnan Studio","Cygames","CA-Cygames Anime Fund"],"Licensors":["Funimation"],"Studios":["Gonzo"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["1: \u0022FIRE GROUND\u0022 by Official HIGE DANdism (Official\u9AED\u7537dism)","2: \u0022Be the NAKED\u0022 by Lead"],"Endings":["1: \u0022Hiizuru Basho (\u65E5\u51FA\u30BA\u30EB\u5834\u6240)\u0022 by Omedetai Atama de Naniyori (\u30AA\u30E1\u3067\u305F\u3044\u982D\u3067\u306A\u306B\u3088\u308A)","2: \u0022Sakura Sake (\u685C\u54B2\u3051\uFF09\u0022 by Yoshida Yamada (\u5409\u7530\u5C71\u7530)"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=13695","LastUpdated":"2023-08-29T23:20:19.362+02:00"},{"Id":37008,"Title":"Tsukipro The Animation 2","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1651/116291.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2021,"Month":7,"Day":7,"Full":"2021-07-07"},"EndDate":{"Year":2021,"Month":12,"Day":29,"Full":"2021-12-29"},"Synopsis":"For the members of SolidS, Growth, SOARA, and QUELL, the Tsukino Talent Productions\u0027 Live 2021 Summer Carnival is coming soon.

Gradually affected by Sora\u0027s impressive skills, sheer effort, and tireless devotion to basketball, the boys unexpectedly find their burnt-out passion for the game rekindling once again.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.27,"Rank":2744,"Popularity":1175,"Genres":[{"Id":30,"Name":"Sports"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":23,"Name":"School"},{"Id":77,"Name":"Team Sports"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":50,"StartSeason":{"Year":2019,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Wednesday","StartTime":"17:55"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1460,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":38054,"Completed":78007,"OnHold":14784,"Dropped":20940,"PlanToWatch":41000,"Total":192785},"Favorites":832,"Producers":["TV Tokyo","Kodansha","AT-X","King Records","DMM pictures"],"Licensors":["Sentai Filmworks"],"Studios":["Diomed\u00E9a"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["1: \u0022Happy Go Ducky!\u0022 by the pillows (eps 1-13)","2: \u0022Nevermind (\u30CD\u30D0\u30FC\u30DE\u30A4\u30F3\u30C9)\u0022 by flumpool (eps 13-24)","3: \u0022Humming Bird (\u30CF\u30DF\u30F3\u30B0\u30D0\u30FC\u30C9)\u0022 by BLUE ENCOUNT (eps 25-36)","4: \u0022Rebirth\u0022 by ACIDMAN (eps 37-49)"],"Endings":["1: \u0022Tsubasa (\u30C4\u30D0\u30B5)\u0022 by Saji (saji-\u30B5\u30B8) (eps 1-13)","2: \u0022Over\u0022 by Yuuma Uchida (eps 13-24)","3: \u0022Hikari Sasu Hou e (\u5149\u5C04\u3059\u65B9\u3078)\u0022 by Mamoru Miyano (eps 25-36)","4: \u0022Taiyou Runner (\u592A\u967D\u30E9\u30F3\u30CA\u30FC)\u0022 by Shougo Sakamoto (eps 37-38, 40-49)","5: \u0022Happy Go Ducky!\u0022 by the pillows (eps 50)"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=13848","LastUpdated":"2023-08-29T23:24:29.698+02:00"},{"Id":37404,"Title":"Circus","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1939/90811.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2018,"Month":2,"Day":28,"Full":"2018-02-28"},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"2018-02-28"},"Synopsis":"A concept movie music video for Super Junior-D\u0026E\u0027s single Circus.

Among the chaos, Thorfinn must take his revenge and kill Askeladd, the man who murdered his father.

The Houtua twin sisters, Maina and Miana, lead him to the skeletal remains of Mecha-Godzilla, an old anti-Godzilla weapon, which to everyone\u0027s surprise is still alive in the form of self-generating nanometal. Taken from the Mecha-Godzilla carcass, the nanometals have gradually been rebuilding a \u0022Mecha-Godzilla City,\u0022 a potential weapon capable of destroying Godzilla Earth.\n\nAs the strategy develops, a rift forms between the humans and the Bilusaludo, one of several alien races that had joined the humans on their exodus from Earth. Their leader, Galu-gu, believes that the secret to defeating Godzilla lies in the use of superhuman powers \u2013 namely, the nanometal integration \u2013 but Haruo resists, fearing that in defeating monsters, they must not become monsters themselves. Haruo ultimately uses his means for defeating Godzilla Earth to destroy the Mecha-Godzilla city so as to prevent nanometal assimilation, killing Galu-gu. However, his childhood friend, Yuuko, has been absorbed by the nanometal integration and has fallen into a brain dead coma.\n\nThe human race, once again, is lost. Metphies, commander of the priestly alien race, Exif, marvels at the miraculous survival of Haruo, he begins to attract a following. The Exif has secretly harbored this outcome as their \u0022ultimate goal.\u0022 Miana and Maina issue warnings against Metphies, while Haruo begins to question mankind\u0027s next move.\n\nWith no means for defeating Godzilla Earth, mankind watches as King Ghidorah, clad in a golden light, descends on the planet. The earth shakes once again with as war moves to a higher dimension.\n\nWhat is Godzilla exactly? Does mankind stand a chance? Is there a future vision in Haruo\u0027s eyes? Find out in the finale.\n\n(Source: Official
