of the dead. For Tomoya Sugisaki, Aoi Harukawa, and Ryou Kobayashi, fireworks are what allowed them to meet the Summer Ghost. Believed to be the spirit of a young woman who committed suicide, the Summer Ghost only appears in a specific area and can only be seen by those who are within arm\u0027s reach of death. \n\nTomoya is a creative soul being crushed by his academic obligation to get into a good university. Aoi is a meek girl who is relentlessly bullied by her classmates. Ryou is a former basketball star who had to forfeit his passion following a grim diagnosis. The only thing these three have in common is their ability to see the Summer Ghost. The Summer Ghost is said to be able to answer any and all questions pertaining to death\u2014something the three teenagers desperately want to know more about.\n\nDissatisfied with their initial meeting, Tomoya sets out to find the Summer Ghost once again. But the more time he spends with the ghost, the more the mystery surrounding her existence unravels.\n\n[Written by MAL

So, while pretending to be a completely average student during the day, he arms himself with a crowbar and ruthlessly thrashes local biker gangs at night. Yet when Minoru finds himself in a truck accident, his ambitions seemingly come to a sudden end. In his final moments, he laments his powerlessness\u2014no matter how much he trained, there was nothing he could do to overcome his human limitations.\n\nBut instead of dying, Minoru reawakens as Cid, the second child of the noble Kagenou family, in another world\u2014one where magic is commonplace. With the power he so desired finally within his grasp, he dons the moniker \u0022Shadow\u0022 and establishes Shadow Garden: a group whose sole purpose is to combat the enigmatic Cult of Diablos, an organization born from Cid\u0027s imagination. However, as Shadow Garden grows in both membership and influence, it becomes increasingly apparent that the Cult of Diablos is not as fictional as Cid had intended.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":8.31,"Rank":241,"Popularity":413,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"},{"Id":62,"Name":"Isekai"},{"Id":72,"Name":"Reincarnation"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":20,"StartSeason":{"Year":2022,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Wednesday","StartTime":"22:30"},"Source":"Light Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":1420,"Rating":"R","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":97728,"Completed":279557,"OnHold":8381,"Dropped":12446,"PlanToWatch":106819},"NumListUsers":504931},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T18:13:58.555+02:00"},{"Id":48317,"Title":"Iyagi Yeohaeng","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1551/114508.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1551/114508l.jpg"},"StartDate":"2014","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2014,"Month":null,"Day":null},"EndDate":"2015","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2015,"Month":null,"Day":null},"Synopsis":"","Mean":null,"Rank":19886,"Popularity":21108,"Genres":[{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"},{"Id":15,"Name":"Kids"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":96,"StartSeason":{"Year":null,"Season":null},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Unknown","AverageEpisodeDuration":740,"Rating":"PG","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":5,"Completed":33,"OnHold":1,"Dropped":25,"PlanToWatch":26},"NumListUsers":90},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T18:13:59.344+02:00"},{"Id":48318,"Title":"Iljimae","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1875/114510.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1875/114510l.jpg"},"StartDate":"May 05 2009","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2009,"Month":5,"Day":5},"EndDate":"Nov 02 2009","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2009,"Month":11,"Day":2},"Synopsis":"","Mean":null,"Rank":19838,"Popularity":19139,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":26,"StartSeason":{"Year":2009,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Other","AverageEpisodeDuration":0,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":12,"Completed":40,"OnHold":4,"Dropped":34,"PlanToWatch":108},"NumListUsers":198},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T18:14:00.619+02:00"},{"Id":48320,"Title":"Jeonsa Ryan","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1864/114505.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1864/114505l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Jul 19 1997","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":1997,"Month":7,"Day":19},"EndDate":"Jul 19 1997","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":1997,"Month":7,"Day":19},"Synopsis":"","Mean":null,"Rank":19903,"Popularity":20582,"Genres":[{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"},{"Id":15,"Name":"Kids"}],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":1997,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Game","AverageEpisodeDuration":4800,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":6,"Completed":35,"OnHold":6,"Dropped":25,"PlanToWatch":44},"NumListUsers":116},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T18:14:02.363+02:00"},{"Id":48321,"Title":"Jeong-geul-eseo Sal-anamgi: Maru Adventure","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1419/115255.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1419/115255l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Aug 31 2015","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2015,"Month":8,"Day":31},"EndDate":"Aug 29 2016","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2016,"Month":8,"Day":29},"Synopsis":"Maru and friends\u0027 exciting adventure begin when they were lost in Borneo Jungle.

Since then, the space race between the confederacy and its competitor, the United Kingdom of Arnack, has intensified; the two countries hope to one day send humans to the cosmos above.\n\nAs a dog\u0027s biology is inherently different from a human\u0027s anatomy, there is no way to perfectly identify the risks involving space travel and its effects on an individual\u0027s body without actually sending someone for observation. However, Zirnitra\u0027s government has a potential solution: to experiment on vampires, whose biological similarity to humans is too significant to ignore.\n\nDespite being forcibly taken from her home in the mountains, vampire Irina Luminesk shows no resistance and is even willing to train as a test subject. Lev Leps, a former top candidate to become the first human cosmonaut, is designated to accompany Irina and act as her guide. Through their time together, Irina and Lev begin to develop a mutual love for outer space, bringing them closer together.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.31,"Rank":2572,"Popularity":1509,"Genres":[{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"},{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"},{"Id":38,"Name":"Military"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"},{"Id":29,"Name":"Space"},{"Id":32,"Name":"Vampire"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2021,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Sunday","StartTime":"01:35"},"Source":"Light Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":1431,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":18881,"Completed":56634,"OnHold":5427,"Dropped":7627,"PlanToWatch":53898},"NumListUsers":142467},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T18:16:36.384+02:00"},{"Id":48480,"Title":"Wan Jie Shen Zhu 3rd Season","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1436/113495.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1436/113495l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Mar 17 2021","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2021,"Month":3,"Day":17},"EndDate":"Mar 04 2023","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2023,"Month":3,"Day":4},"Synopsis":"Third season of Wan Jie Shen Zhu.","Mean":6.64,"Rank":5806,"Popularity":12595,"Genres":[{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"}],"MediaType":"ONA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":208,"StartSeason":{"Year":2021,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Web Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":540,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":410,"Completed":156,"OnHold":60,"Dropped":93,"PlanToWatch":337},"NumListUsers":1056},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T18:16:45.831+02:00"},{"Id":48481,"Title":"Daomu Biji Zhi Qinling Shen Shu","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1166/113496.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1166/113496l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Apr 04 2021","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2021,"Month":4,"Day":4},"EndDate":"Jun 13 2021","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2021,"Month":6,"Day":13},"Synopsis":"After experiencing two adventurous events, Wu Xie returned to Hangzhou from Nansha.

As a result, schools have begun incorporating these technologies into their curriculum, leaving behind the ways of the old. One such institution is the elite Yuyu Girls\u0027 Vocational High School, where both Serufu Yua and her childhood friend, Miku \u0022Purin\u0022 Suride, have applied. Although the tech-savvy Purin is accepted to Yuyu High, the accident-prone Serufu is rejected and enters the traditional Gatagata Girls\u0027 High School instead, driving a wedge into their friendship.\n\nOn her way to class one day, Serufu gets into a bike accident, and Rei Yasaku, a passerby who attends the same school, fixes her damaged bicycle. Serufu later finds out that Rei has a passion for old-fashioned crafts and is the head of the school\u0027s Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Club\u2014which is in danger of closing due to a lack of members.\n\nRealizing that this may be her chance to repair her relationship with Purin, Serufu joins the club in hopes of creating projects that could bring them together once more. As the DIY Club welcomes new faces, Serufu learns to build not only handicrafts but also new friendships along the way!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.47,"Rank":1868,"Popularity":1978,"Genres":[{"Id":52,"Name":"CGDCT"},{"Id":23,"Name":"School"},{"Id":36,"Name":"Slice of Life"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2022,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Thrusday","StartTime":"00:00"},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":1420,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":14449,"Completed":38401,"OnHold":3239,"Dropped":5230,"PlanToWatch":37542},"NumListUsers":98861},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T18:17:49.107+02:00"},{"Id":48543,"Title":"Shouxi Yu Ling Shi 2","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1507/113661.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1507/113661l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Mar 03 2021","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2021,"Month":3,"Day":3},"EndDate":"Sep 15 2021","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2021,"Month":9,"Day":15},"Synopsis":"Second season of Shouxi Yu Ling Shi.\n","Mean":6.18,"Rank":8344,"Popularity":13934,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"}],"MediaType":"ONA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":60,"StartSeason":{"Year":2021,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":679,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":165,"Completed":205,"OnHold":35,"Dropped":78,"PlanToWatch":224},"NumListUsers":707},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T18:17:49.785+02:00"},{"Id":48544,"Title":"Ikinuke!

Ten years later, the best wine can be brewed. Finally, he stole a land deed from his home and ran hundreds of miles to Chaisang City to open a wine shop. But a long street is already full of evil stars. Only he is really a young boy who is serious about making wine.

The central character, Shinji, is a boy who loves to draw. In elementary school, he encounters Masaru, a strange young boy who also loves drawing, but who draws only masked wrestlers. The two become friends. \n\nAs they progress through their elementary school grades, however, they gradually grow apart. Years later, Shinji still remains true to his dream of becoming a manga artist, and goes on to study art at the university. When his work is selected for a Best Young Artist Award, he decides to move to Tokyo and soon gets his first breakthrough. What awaits him there, though, is something completely different from the manga artist\u2019s life that he had imagined. One day, for the first time in years, the 30-year-old Shinji comes across some work of his old friend Masaru, who has remained true to his drawing style. \n\nThe story is a mockumentary (\u0022mock documentary\u0022), and the narration is interspersed with monologues by Shinji\u0027s mother. As the central character grows, the animation style evolves from juvenile drawings doodled on random pieces of paper to sketches drawn on specialized manga paper, thus visualizing the flow of time.\n\n(Source: Japan Media Arts Festival)","Mean":6.94,"Rank":4339,"Popularity":12962,"Genres":[{"Id":5,"Name":"Avant Garde"},{"Id":46,"Name":"Award Winning"},{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"}],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2019,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":1261,"Rating":"R\u002B","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":27,"Completed":517,"OnHold":10,"Dropped":39,"PlanToWatch":350},"NumListUsers":943},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T18:25:30.119+02:00"},{"Id":48994,"Title":"Closure no Kimitsu File","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1852/131810.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1852/131810l.jpg"},"StartDate":"May 16 2021","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2021,"Month":5,"Day":16},"EndDate":"Nov 21 2021","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2021,"Month":11,"Day":21},"Synopsis":"Animated shorts showing the daily life on Rhodes Island.","Mean":6.13,"Rank":8613,"Popularity":18049,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"}],"MediaType":"ONA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":17,"StartSeason":{"Year":2021,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Game","AverageEpisodeDuration":131,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":11,"Completed":161,"OnHold":5,"Dropped":20,"PlanToWatch":64},"NumListUsers":261},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T18:25:31.89+02:00"},{"Id":48997,"Title":"Fantasy Bishoujo Juniku Ojisan to","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1430/120065.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1430/120065l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Jan 12 2022","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2022,"Month":1,"Day":12},"EndDate":"Mar 30 2022","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2022,"Month":3,"Day":30},"Synopsis":"Since their days as students, Tsukasa Jinguuji has had incredible luck with women due to his good looks; Hinata Tachibana has had almost none, overshadowed by Jinguuji\u0027s brilliance.
