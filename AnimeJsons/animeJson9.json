In the 1990s-era Osteandel City is the headquarters of Time Lease, a business that leases almost everything you could ask for including powerful robots. They are proud of themselves for being number one in the international ranking of billionaires, for the past ten consecutive years. Meanwhile there is another lease company in the same city called Skull Lease where the notorious villain trio work as top executives. Their ostensible object is to disgrace the credit of Time Lease and replace them as the leading enterprise. In fact, however, they have a scheme to secure a footing for world conquest. One day a transport robot of Time Lease is assaulted by the villain trio and it is time for Ippatsuman to get on the move to fight for justice.\n\n(Source: ANN)","Mean":5.9,"Rank":9757,"Popularity":12264,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":18,"Name":"Mecha"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":58,"StartSeason":{"Year":1982,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Unknown","AverageEpisodeDuration":1440,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":73,"Completed":376,"OnHold":54,"Dropped":161,"PlanToWatch":510},"NumListUsers":1174},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T22:03:00.118+02:00"},{"Id":8017,"Title":"Soukou Kihei Votoms: Genei-hen","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1553/97716.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1553/97716l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Mar 26 2010","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2010,"Month":3,"Day":26},"EndDate":"Oct 27 2010","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2010,"Month":10,"Day":27},"Synopsis":"For their silver anniversary, Vanilla and Coconna return to Uoodo along with Gotho in the hopes of reuniting with Chirico.

The only way to win is by knocking out the opponent. Akira, a young man isolated from his family, is known to be undefeatable at Bl@ster. However, his life on the top is shattered when he is accused of murder.

Unusually for an anime, a narrator reads Kenji\u0027s story aloud while the action is played out on the screen by a succession of warm and evocative illustrations brought to life by subtle touches of animation. If the film feels somehow familiar yet you can\u0027t put your finger on the reason why, it\u0027s probably the sumptuously minimalist animation by Yasuhiro Nagura, who was the animation director of Mamoru Oshii\u0027s artsy 1986 feature Angel\u0027s Egg. That, and Kenji\u0027s wildcat is said to have been the inspiration for Miyazaki\u0027s Panda/Totoro creature. The idea of reading Kenji\u0027s story aloud instead of playing it out as a drama is quite refreshing, and Kenji\u0027s magical language and narrative style are entirely sufficient to sustain interest. Combined with the spacey music and breathtaking art, the result is a pleasantly unassuming little gem of a film.\n\n(Source: pelleas.net)","Mean":5.9,"Rank":9733,"Popularity":12912,"Genres":[{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"}],"MediaType":"OVA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":1988,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Unknown","AverageEpisodeDuration":1450,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":34,"Completed":379,"OnHold":21,"Dropped":60,"PlanToWatch":463},"NumListUsers":957},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-10T00:25:34.955+02:00"},{"Id":8456,"Title":"Queen\u0027s Blade: Utsukushiki Toushi-tachi","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/34325.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/34325l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Aug 08 2010","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2010,"Month":8,"Day":8},"EndDate":"Mar 14 2011","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2011,"Month":3,"Day":14},"Synopsis":"Queen\u0027s Blade OVA.
