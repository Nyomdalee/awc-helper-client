In the 1990s-era Osteandel City is the headquarters of Time Lease, a business that leases almost everything you could ask for including powerful robots. They are proud of themselves for being number one in the international ranking of billionaires, for the past ten consecutive years. Meanwhile there is another lease company in the same city called Skull Lease where the notorious villain trio work as top executives. Their ostensible object is to disgrace the credit of Time Lease and replace them as the leading enterprise. In fact, however, they have a scheme to secure a footing for world conquest. One day a transport robot of Time Lease is assaulted by the villain trio and it is time for Ippatsuman to get on the move to fight for justice.\n\n(Source: ANN)","Mean":5.89,"Rank":9800,"Popularity":12284,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":18,"Name":"Mecha"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":58,"StartSeason":{"Year":1982,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Unknown","AverageEpisodeDuration":1440,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":77,"Completed":377,"OnHold":55,"Dropped":161,"PlanToWatch":513,"Total":1183},"Favorites":0,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Tatsunoko Production"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Gyakuten Ippatsuman (\u9006\u8EE2\u30A4\u30C3\u30D1\u30C4\u30DE\u30F3)\u0022 by \u30B8\u30E3\u30E9, Igarashi Rei, Kawakami Tomoko, \u7DBE\u5D0E\u30DF\u30AD, Takemasa Hiroko, Pink Piggies, Yamamoto Masayuki, Hamura Kyouko, \u9AD8\u67F3\u5BCC\u5B50, \u91CD\u7530\u7531\u7F8E\u5B50, \u4E2D\u5C3E\u7F8E\u8CB4"],"Endings":["\u0022Shibibiin Rhapsody (\u30B7\u30D3\u30D3\u30FC\u30F3\u30FB\u30E9\u30D7\u30BD\u30C7\u30A3\u30FC)\u0022 by \u30B8\u30E3\u30E9, Igarashi Rei, Kawakami Tomoko, \u7DBE\u5D0E\u30DF\u30AD, Takemasa Hiroko, Pink Piggies, Yamamoto Masayuki, Hamura Kyouko, \u9AD8\u67F3\u5BCC\u5B50, \u91CD\u7530\u7531\u7F8E\u5B50, \u4E2D\u5C3E\u7F8E\u8CB4"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=2549","LastUpdated":"2023-09-08T22:18:02.7210941Z"},{"Id":8017,"Title":"Soukou Kihei Votoms: Genei-hen","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1553/97716.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2010,"Month":3,"Day":26,"Full":"2010-03-26"},"EndDate":{"Year":2010,"Month":10,"Day":27,"Full":"2010-10-27"},"Synopsis":"For their silver anniversary, Vanilla and Coconna return to Uoodo along with Gotho in the hopes of reuniting with Chirico.

Fortunately, Shuuichi has a childhood friend who has similar feelings of discomfort related to gender identity: the lanky tomboy Yoshino Takatsuki, who, though biologically female, does not identify as a girl. These two friends share a similar secret and find solace in one another; however, their lives become even more complicated when they must tread the unfamiliar waters of a new school, attempt to make new friends, and struggle to maintain old ones. Faced with nearly insurmountable odds, they must learn to deal with the harsh realities of growing up, being transgender, relationships, and acceptance.\n\nLauded as a decidedly serious take on gender identity and LGBT struggles, Takako Shimura\u0027s Hourou Musuko is about Shuuichi and Yoshino\u0027s attempts to discover their true selves as they enter puberty, make friends, fall in love, and face some very real and difficult choices.","Mean":7.7,"Rank":1181,"Popularity":1655,"Genres":[{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":81,"Name":"Crossdressing"},{"Id":23,"Name":"School"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":42,"Name":"Seinen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":11,"StartSeason":{"Year":2011,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Friday","StartTime":"01:15"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1380,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":7017,"Completed":47312,"OnHold":5534,"Dropped":5661,"PlanToWatch":62064,"Total":127588},"Favorites":1055,"Producers":["Aniplex","AIC","Dentsu","Fuji TV","Magic Capsule","Enterbrain","Fujipacific Music"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["AIC Classic"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Itsudatte\u0022 by Daisuke (eps 1-10)"],"Endings":["1: \u0022For You\u0022 by Rie Fu","2: \u0022Itsudatte\u0022 by Daisuke (eps 11)"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=7949","LastUpdated":"2023-09-08T22:18:02.7245575Z"},{"Id":8431,"Title":"Mahou no Star Magical Emi: Kumo Hikaru","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/60083.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2002,"Month":5,"Day":25,"Full":"2002-05-25"},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"2002-05-25"},"Synopsis":"Kazuki Mai, an elementary schoolgirl, wanted to be a magician but her skills weren\u0027t good enough for here to join her grandparents\u0027 Magiccarat troupe.

However, his life on the top is shattered when he is accused of murder.

Unusually for an anime, a narrator reads Kenji\u0027s story aloud while the action is played out on the screen by a succession of warm and evocative illustrations brought to life by subtle touches of animation. If the film feels somehow familiar yet you can\u0027t put your finger on the reason why, it\u0027s probably the sumptuously minimalist animation by Yasuhiro Nagura, who was the animation director of Mamoru Oshii\u0027s artsy 1986 feature Angel\u0027s Egg. That, and Kenji\u0027s wildcat is said to have been the inspiration for Miyazaki\u0027s Panda/Totoro creature. The idea of reading Kenji\u0027s story aloud instead of playing it out as a drama is quite refreshing, and Kenji\u0027s magical language and narrative style are entirely sufficient to sustain interest.

After a gestation period of 3.5 years, Lady Yin, the wife of General Li Jing, gives birth to a flesh ball, which becomes a lotus flower, from which Nezha is born. Nezha is born able to walk and talk, and is taken on as a student of the immortal Taiyi Zhenren.\n\nThe Dragon Kings of the Four Seas, tired of being peaceful, have become cruel and destructive, plaguing China with destructive storms and a drought. The people beg for rain, but the East Sea Dragon King Ao Guang ignores them, telling the yaksha Ye Sha to go and find children for him to eat. Ye Sha captures one of Nezha\u0027s friends as he is bathing by the ocean, and Nezha confronts him, injuring him badly. Ao Guang sends his third son, Ao Bing, next. Ao Bing is killed by Nezha, infuriating Ao Guang.\n\nA variety of confrontations ensue between Nezha and Ao Guang. Ao Guang and the other Dragon Kings wreak havoc on the people, causing storms, floods and all manners of natural disasters. Seeing this, Nezha takes his father\u0027s sword, tells his parents that he is returning their flesh and bones to them, and calls out for his master before committing suicide by slitting his throat.\n\nHe is reborn with the help of his master, again from a lotus blossom, and is given new weapons and abilities.
