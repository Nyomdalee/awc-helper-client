Players move up and down courts based on \u0022shuffle matches\u0022 that occur before practice begins each day. In anticipation of a game, the middle schoolers are asked to pair up with one another, only to find out that they would not be playing doubles with their partners. Instead, they are pitted against each other in a tiebreaker-style game. The winner of the match would be allowed to stay to further develop their skills whereas the loser would be sent home.\n\nFor the sake of tennis, friendships and camaraderie are all put on the line. As the fierce competition between the middle and high schoolers persists, the situations they find themselves in goes deeper than just playing to remain in the camp.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.54,"Rank":1644,"Popularity":2628,"Genres":[{"Id":23,"Name":"School"},{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"},{"Id":30,"Name":"Sports"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":13,"StartSeason":{"Year":2012,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1420,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":2658,"Completed":43733,"OnHold":1495,"Dropped":1545,"PlanToWatch":12806},"NumListUsers":62237},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-10T00:45:24.263+02:00"},{"Id":11375,"Title":".hack//The Movie: Sekai no Mukou ni","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/35633.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/35633l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Jan 21 2012","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2012,"Month":1,"Day":21},"EndDate":"Jan 21 2012","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2012,"Month":1,"Day":21},"Synopsis":"In 2024, the computer network prevails throughout daily life.

She explains to Mahiro that the creature chasing him was an alien called Nightgaunt, who had planned on abducting and selling him as a slave.\n\nAfter rescuing him from the alien, the Lovecraftian deity falls madly in love with Mahiro and forces herself into his household, much to his chagrin. Moreover, they are soon joined by two others from the fictional universe: Cthuko, a girl obsessed with Nyaruko, and Hasuta, a young boy easily mistaken for a beautiful female. Together, the three eccentric aliens protect Mahiro from the various extraterrestrial dangers that threaten both his and Earth\u0027s well-being, all the while making his life a living hell.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":6.99,"Rank":4159,"Popularity":637,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":20,"Name":"Parody"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2012,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Light Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":1440,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":20506,"Completed":190777,"OnHold":12413,"Dropped":17153,"PlanToWatch":108067},"NumListUsers":348916},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-10T00:47:07.664+02:00"},{"Id":11787,"Title":"Toriko: Barbarian Ivy wo Hokaku Seyo!","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/32953.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/32953l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Oct 23 2010","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2010,"Month":10,"Day":23},"EndDate":"Oct 23 2010","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2010,"Month":10,"Day":23},"Synopsis":"Special shown at the Jump Super Anime Tour in 2010.","Mean":6.62,"Rank":5944,"Popularity":9270,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":47,"Name":"Gourmet"},{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"},{"Id":31,"Name":"Super Power"}],"MediaType":"Special","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2010,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Unknown","AverageEpisodeDuration":2415,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":109,"Completed":1440,"OnHold":87,"Dropped":140,"PlanToWatch":1555},"NumListUsers":3331},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-10T00:47:08.874+02:00"},{"Id":11789,"Title":"Wish Me Mell","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/32955.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/32955l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Jun 05 2011","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2011,"Month":6,"Day":5},"EndDate":"Jul 20 2012","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2012,"Month":7,"Day":20},"Synopsis":"The characters in Sanrio\u0027s \u0022Wish me mell\u0022 line star in three short specials.","Mean":5.44,"Rank":11403,"Popularity":14790,"Genres":[{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"},{"Id":15,"Name":"Kids"}],"MediaType":"ONA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":3,"StartSeason":{"Year":2011,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Other","AverageEpisodeDuration":78,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":16,"Completed":323,"OnHold":8,"Dropped":56,"PlanToWatch":143},"NumListUsers":546},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-10T00:47:09.333+02:00"},{"Id":11791,"Title":"Sore Ike!
