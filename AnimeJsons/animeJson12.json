But when he goes to the zoo to find one, an old man tells him of the tragic day when the zoo animals were slaughtered.\n\nThe story is based on true historical events of the Ueno Zoo in Tokyo, where dangerous animals during WW2 were slaughtered in order to prevent them from wreaking havoc in case Allied bombings would let the animals escape. Various methods were used such as starvation, poisoning, death by firing squad, and decapitation. Tokyo was bombed over a year later after the animals\u0027 slaughter and Ueno Zoo was never hit.\n\n(Source: The Anime Encyclopedia and Wikipedia)","Mean":null,"Rank":14746,"Popularity":15931,"Genres":[{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":1982,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Unknown","AverageEpisodeDuration":4708,"Rating":"PG","Statistics":{"Watching":20,"Completed":171,"OnHold":7,"Dropped":86,"PlanToWatch":139,"Total":423},"Favorites":1,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":[],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=6386","LastUpdated":"2023-09-08T22:18:02.75195Z"},{"Id":11099,"Title":"Tiger \u0026 Bunny Pilot","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/30751.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2011,"Month":5,"Day":27,"Full":"2011-05-27"},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"2011-05-27"},"Synopsis":"The pilot episode for Tiger \u0026 Bunny released on the first DVD \u0026 BD volume.","Mean":6.16,"Rank":8464,"Popularity":6204,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":31,"Name":"Super Power"}],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"Special","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2011,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":133,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":174,"Completed":6183,"OnHold":104,"Dropped":123,"PlanToWatch":3120,"Total":9704},"Favorites":4,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Sunrise"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=8101","LastUpdated":"2023-09-08T22:18:02.7519699Z"},{"Id":11101,"Title":"Honoo no Alpenrose","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/30729.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":1986,"Month":2,"Day":15,"Full":"1986-02-15"},"EndDate":{"Year":1986,"Month":3,"Day":31,"Full":"1986-03-31"},"Synopsis":"Two-part OVA that summarises the entire Honoo no Alpenrose TV series featuring a new dubbing and reworked scenes.\n\n(Source: AniDB)","Mean":6.08,"Rank":8924,"Popularity":13258,"Genres":[{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":25,"Name":"Shoujo"}],"MediaType":"OVA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":2,"StartSeason":{"Year":1986,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":4560,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":50,"Completed":364,"OnHold":20,"Dropped":82,"PlanToWatch":361,"Total":877},"Favorites":2,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Tatsunoko Production"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Yume no Tsubasa: Alpen Rose (\u5922\u306E\u7FFC~\u30A2\u30EB\u30DA\u30F3\u30ED\u30FC\u30BC~)\u0022 by Konii"],"Endings":["\u0022Yancha na Angel (\u3084\u3093\u3061\u3083\u306A\u30A8\u30F3\u30B8\u30A7\u30EB)\u0022 by Konii"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=8559","LastUpdated":"2023-09-08T22:18:02.7519914Z"},{"Id":11103,"Title":"Busou Shinki Moon Angel","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/37953.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2011,"Month":9,"Day":7,"Full":"2011-09-07"},"EndDate":{"Year":2012,"Month":1,"Day":26,"Full":"2012-01-26"},"Synopsis":"The story follows the coming of age and Shinki battles of Tsubasa, a boy who dreams of becoming a Shinki Master, and his Shinki partner Arnval Mk. 2.\n\n(Source: ANN)","Mean":6.54,"Rank":6385,"Popularity":5511,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[],"Demographics":[],"MediaType":"ONA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":10,"StartSeason":{"Year":2011,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Other","AverageEpisodeDuration":300,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Watching":684,"Completed":7312,"OnHold":506,"Dropped":672,"PlanToWatch":3874,"Total":13048},"Favorites":5,"Producers":[],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["TNK","Kinema Citrus"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":["\u0022Labyrinth\u0022 by MIQ"],"Endings":["\u0022Kayowaki Juujika no Ai\u0022 by KEI"]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=8513","LastUpdated":"2023-09-08T22:18:02.7520108Z"},{"Id":11111,"Title":"Another","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/75509.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2012,"Month":1,"Day":10,"Full":"2012-01-10"},"EndDate":{"Year":2012,"Month":3,"Day":27,"Full":"2012-03-27"},"Synopsis":"In class 3-3 of Yomiyama North Junior High, transfer student Kouichi Sakakibara makes his return after taking a sick leave for the first month of school.
