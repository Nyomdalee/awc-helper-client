Like the previous movie, the stories deal with seeing the world through the eyes of people who are different from social norms.  The film was nominated for Best Animated Feature in 2008 from the Asia Pacific Screen Awards.\n\n1. \u0022The Third Wish\u201D (AN Dong-hui, RYU Jeong-wu). A fairy godmother appears before a visually impaired young woman to grant her three wishes. But this is no fairytale. The irritable middle-aged fairy wants to finish her job as soon as possible. Yet she proves to be helpful as she leads the woman through a busy marketplace, which is delightfully reminiscent of \u0022Amelie\u0022. But it\u0027s no walk in the park, as busy urbanites show no consideration for our protagonist. Yet she prevails through obstacles. With a walking stick, she taps together the heels of her shiny new shoes and follows the \u0022yellow brick road\u0022 (guiding tiles for the visually impaired) around the city.\n\n2. \u0022Ajukari\u201D (HONG Deok-pyo) is a street-style cartoon. It comically depicts how a certain macho \u0022complex\u0022 can cripple men. Male circumcision becomes the ultimate standard for being \u0022manly\u0022 and those who have failed to do the deed are forever fearful of going to public baths.\n\n3. \u0022Baby\u0022 (LEE Hong-su, LEE Hong-min) portrays the difficulties a career woman faces in having a child. \u0022I\u0027m not saying you can\u0027t have maternity leave, but can you afford to raise a child while working?\u0022 asks her boss. This smart story portrays everything from mother and daughter-in-law relationships to a parody of \u0022Tazza: The High Rollers\u0022 and hilarious episodes where an \u0022ambulance bus\u0022 picks up several patients en route.\n\n4. \u0022Shine Shine Shining\u0022 (KWON Mi-jeong) is drawn like a warm, watercolor storybook for children. Grade schooler Eun-jin is smart and popular, but she has a secret. She hides her curly hair, which she gets from her Filipino mother, in braids.\n\n5. \u0022Merry Golasmas\u0022 is an adorable claymation, or stop motion animation of models constructed from clay, plasticine, etc. It explores physical discrimination or stereotypes. In an open audition to find a Santa Claus, the real Santas \u2015 one who\u0027s black, another who\u0027s Asian, a female Santa and one in a wheelchair \u2015 lose to a fake Santa, a pot-bellied, Caucasian.\n\n6. \u201CLies\u0022 explores homosexuality. Drawn in pastel-like sketches with art deco-esque details, it is a stunning digital cut-out animation, A homosexual man is forced by his parents to marry a woman, while others are pressured to fake having a girlfriend or receive \u0022therapy\u0022 to become straight.\n\n(Source: The Korean Times)","Mean":null,"Rank":18175,"Popularity":16870,"Genres":[{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":40,"Name":"Psychological"}],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":6,"StartSeason":{"Year":2008,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Unknown","AverageEpisodeDuration":947,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":16,"Completed":128,"OnHold":5,"Dropped":74,"PlanToWatch":120},"NumListUsers":343},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-10T00:32:19.957+02:00"},{"Id":9451,"Title":"Sore Ike!

To convince her to fulfill her duties, one of her attendants, Judith Snorrevik, goes to the human realm to find a human male whom Lotte can tolerate.\n\nJudith returns with 23-year-old Naoya Touhara, a single father who unfortunately leaves his daughter, Asuha, behind in the human realm. As the first member of Lotte\u0027s harem, Naoya quickly adapts to this new environment, serving the princess to make her happy, rather than viewing her with sexual intent.

However, when he arrives in his apartment, he encounters a strange man nonchalantly reading and wearing his clothes! The stranger claims to be an alien who crash-landed on Earth and has nowhere to go. Revealing himself to be Baka Ki El Dogra, the crown prince of the planet Dogra, he is just one of the hundreds of aliens that have already made Earth their home.\n\nDespite his regal origins, the prince is an infamous intergalactic fool who thinks nothing of inconveniencing others for his own amusement. Whether he is running ridiculous tests on his subordinates, giving strange powers to random children, or just generally being a nuisance, nobody is safe from the idiot prince\u0027s antics!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.41,"Rank":2080,"Popularity":2058,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":57,"Name":"Gag Humor"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"},{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":13,"StartSeason":{"Year":2011,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Tuesday","StartTime":null},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1464,"Rating":"R","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":4779,"Completed":46096,"OnHold":3813,"Dropped":5385,"PlanToWatch":33019},"NumListUsers":93092},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-10T00:35:03.423+02:00"},{"Id":9837,"Title":"Emblem Take 2","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/27231.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/27231l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Oct 25 1993","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":1993,"Month":10,"Day":25},"EndDate":"Nov 21 1995","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":1995,"Month":11,"Day":21},"Synopsis":"Shinjuku, 1983.

Ten years in the making and entirely, single-handedly rendered in colored pencil, Kurosaka\u0027s fantastical labor of love is a marvel to behold. Emerging from the staggering detail and craft flooding every frame is the story of a young woman who sets out to engineer a dream-food that can put an end to the world\u0027s famine. Synthesizing Frederic Back\u0027s subtle, haptic textures with Bill Plympton\u0027s frenetic mutations and David Lynch\u0027s haunting wormholes, Kurosaka\u2019s work still retains its own singular, luminous potency.\n\n(Source: Los Angeles Animation Festival summary)","Mean":5.99,"Rank":9322,"Popularity":8504,"Genres":[{"Id":5,"Name":"Avant Garde"},{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"}],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2011,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Original","AverageEpisodeDuration":3300,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":172,"Completed":1238,"OnHold":72,"Dropped":82,"PlanToWatch":2805},"NumListUsers":4369},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-10T00:36:31.854+02:00"},{"Id":9991,"Title":"Bremen 4: Jigoku no Naka no Tenshi-tachi","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/46569.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/46569l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Aug 23 1981","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":1981,"Month":8,"Day":23},"EndDate":"Aug 23 1981","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":1981,"Month":8,"Day":23},"Synopsis":"TV anime created as a part of \u002224-Hour Television\u0022.
