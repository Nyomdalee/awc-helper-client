His grades are failing, and his father \u2013 traditional and strict (but who must have also at some point gave in and allowed him to have a motorcycle) \u2013 is trying everything he can think of to get the kid to apply for college. His mother is so silent, she might as well not even exist. Really, his support system lies entirely in his twinkle-toed little sister, who\u0027s nosy but cheers him on in her own way.\n\nBobby really does little else but work on his bike. He cleans his bike. He tunes up his bike. He rides his bike. One would call him a motorcycle otaku. His most recent achievement seems to have been getting photos of himself on a road trip printed in a motorcyclist hobby magazine. This leads to an unexpected result: a girl his age, who picked up that issue on a whim, decides to write him a letter. A long, rambling letter, but dreamily romantic just the same. Bobby admits to his sister that he\u0027s never gotten a letter from a girl before. He writes back, \u0022I got your letter. I\u0027m happy \u0027cause it was from a girl.\u0022\n\nBobby is not a well-rounded kid. He barely speaks \u2013 even to his own family \u2013 and the \u0022letters\u0022 he writes back to the mystery girl usually consist of a single sentence or so. His obsession is all-consuming, to the point where he happily quits school to work at a biker bar. Of course, his father, at a loss, kicks him out of the house. Staying with a friend, he\u0027s delighted when his female pen pal says she\u0027ll call him. On that day, his boss at the bar decides to take him to a motocross track. But that\u0027s a day that wouldn\u0027t end in a way that anybody would expect.\n\n(Source: ANN, edited)","Mean":5.94,"Rank":9568,"Popularity":8679,"Genres":[{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"},{"Id":36,"Name":"Slice of Life"}],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":1985,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":2640,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":98,"Completed":2027,"OnHold":58,"Dropped":100,"PlanToWatch":1822},"NumListUsers":4105},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T21:22:23.155+02:00"},{"Id":3121,"Title":"Kodomo no Jikan OVA","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/5682.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/5682l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Sep 11 2007","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2007,"Month":9,"Day":11},"EndDate":"Jan 21 2011","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2011,"Month":1,"Day":21},"Synopsis":"A series of OVA episodes released with the limited edition manga volumes.\n\nEpisode 01: What You Gave Me (Anata ga Watashi ni Kureta Mono)\nKokonoe, Usa, and Kagami go shopping for a present for Sensei.

After commencing its mission of exploration, the starship Rugger-Guard is attacked by a ship of the Galbeston Empire. Dairugger, the super robot, is deployed in order to defend the Earth. It is somewhat by fate that they must help the people of Galbeston find a new planet before it explodes, and liberate it from its despotic Emperor. In the Japanese version, it does not have anything to do with King of the Beasts GoLion, as opposed to the U.S. version, Voltron: Defender of the Universe.\n\nThere are three assault team units: Land, Air, and Sea. There are a total of 15 parts referred to as \u0022Rugger,\u0022 which can combine together to form the super-robot Dairugger. The design of the 15 separate Rugger units came from the sport of rugby, since 15 players are required to form a rugby union.

Now in her 20s and still unable to forget the man who saved her, Kasahara joins the LDF in the hope of becoming just like her prince.\n\nBut LDF training turns out to be far more rigorous than she could have imagined, and her instructor, LTF member Atsushi Doujou, seems fixated on making her life a living hell. Given her struggles, Kasahara is shocked when she is selected as one of the two new LTF recruits as a result of Doujou\u0027s recommendation. As Kasahara does all she can to become worthy of the LTF and unravel her enigmatic superior\u0027s motivations, she wages war\u2014both on the battlefield and in her personal life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.44,"Rank":1974,"Popularity":2391,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":50,"Name":"Adult Cast"},{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":38,"Name":"Military"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2008,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Friday","StartTime":"00:45"},"Source":"Novel","AverageEpisodeDuration":1380,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":3282,"Completed":32862,"OnHold":2374,"Dropped":2766,"PlanToWatch":31501},"NumListUsers":72785},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T21:28:05.154+02:00"},{"Id":3614,"Title":"Yakushiji Ryouko no Kaiki Jikenbo","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/75426.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/75426l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Jul 06 2008","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2008,"Month":7,"Day":6},"EndDate":"Sep 28 2008","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2008,"Month":9,"Day":28},"Synopsis":"Based on a series of light novels written by Tanaka Yoshiki and illustrated by Kakinouchi Narumi.\n\nThe story revolves around Ryouko Yakushiji, a 27-year-old multilingual investigator that graduated from Tokyo University\u0027s elite Department of Law, and the bizarre cases she faces while working for the Tokyo Metropolitan Police.

(perhaps not surprising for being a film in which Hayao Miyazaki was involved) This film is one of the most rollicking and action-packed films made by Toei, and is in an outrageously cartoonish style breaking with the Toei mold. It has a spectacular lineup of animators including Yasuji Mori, Akira Daikubara, Hayao Miyazaki, Yoichi Kotabe and Reiko Okuyama. The original story about Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves itself is recounted at one point in the film in an unexpected and interesting way using shadow-puppets. \n\n(Source: pelleas.net) ","Mean":5.49,"Rank":11268,"Popularity":11200,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"}],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":1971,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Unknown","AverageEpisodeDuration":3300,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":59,"Completed":985,"OnHold":35,"Dropped":101,"PlanToWatch":532},"NumListUsers":1712},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T21:30:42.944+02:00"},{"Id":3844,"Title":"Apache Yakyuugun","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/78281.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/78281l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Oct 06 1971","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":1971,"Month":10,"Day":6},"EndDate":"Mar 29 1972","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":1972,"Month":3,"Day":29},"Synopsis":"A former baseball star who suffered a career crippling injury takes over as coach of a team of misfits in a poor village high school.\n\n(Source: AniDB)","Mean":6.27,"Rank":7899,"Popularity":12618,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":23,"Name":"School"},{"Id":30,"Name":"Sports"},{"Id":77,"Name":"Team Sports"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":26,"StartSeason":{"Year":1971,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Wednesday","StartTime":"19:30"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1500,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":67,"Completed":310,"OnHold":34,"Dropped":139,"PlanToWatch":496},"NumListUsers":1046},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T21:30:44.018+02:00"},{"Id":3845,"Title":"Mahoutsukai Chappy","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/17490.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/17490l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Apr 03 1972","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":1972,"Month":4,"Day":3},"EndDate":"Dec 25 1972","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":1972,"Month":12,"Day":25},"Synopsis":"Chappy\u0027s story is much like Mahou Tsukai Sally (Little Witch Sally).

Unlike the original International Rescue, which was small-scale and family-oriented, the IRO is a vast organisation comprising numerous branches and overseen by the Federation, the 2086 equivalent of the United Nations. No direct historical connections are identified between the two series, but it can be assumed that the original International Rescue evolved into its 2086 incarnation over those thirty years. The Tracy family are not mentioned in the animated series. In the animated series, the actual team is known as the Thunderbirds, whilst in the original series the name merely referred to their vehicles. The animated series is otherwise very similar to the original, with most episodes revolving around a natural or man-made disaster which the Thunderbirds team must investigate and help resolve. Unlike the original series, Thunderbirds 2086 also has an on-going story arc revolving around a breakaway independence group known as the Shadow Axis, led by the mysterious Star Crusher.
