After failing to acquire the latest version of his favorite game, Hiroshi stumbles upon a game shop and meets its beautiful clerk Reona Kisaragi who convinces him to buy a copy of Kiwame Quest so that they can play together. \n\nThe first time Hiroshi plays the game, he marvels at the realism it offers. However, his astonishment is short-lived as he sets off a series of misfortunes, quickly realizing that the game is even worse than his already stressful life.

Because of this raunchiness, when his daughter Hime was born, he vowed to keep his profession hidden from her, believing that she will be disillusioned if she finds out.\n\nThis paranoia-induced belief leads Kakushi into hectic situations. Despite being a single father, he does his best and often resorts to extreme ends just to protect his secret, such as guising as a salaryman every day or holding emergency drills in case Hime somehow finds her way to his workplace.\n\nKakushigoto tells the story of a father and daughter living side by side, maintaining their peaceful existence as the father attempts to preserve the status quo. However, there is a saying: \u0022there are no secrets that time cannot reveal.\u0022 In time, Hime must learn the reality behind the things she took for granted as she grew up.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.68,"Rank":1215,"Popularity":3367,"Genres":[{"Id":53,"Name":"Childcare"},{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"},{"Id":36,"Name":"Slice of Life"}],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":2021,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":4716,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":1103,"Completed":10665,"OnHold":573,"Dropped":253,"PlanToWatch":26952},"NumListUsers":39546},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T17:10:33.985+02:00"},{"Id":44587,"Title":"Nemurenai Yoru no Tsuki","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1153/110691.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1153/110691l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Sep 05 2015","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2015,"Month":9,"Day":5},"EndDate":"Sep 05 2015","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2015,"Month":9,"Day":5},"Synopsis":"A squirrel and a boy set out on a journey together to restore daylight.

Mirai Kakehashi has lived a life of pain and despair. Every day, he endures abuse at the hands of the relatives who took him in. As his anguish steadily chips away at his will to live, he is eventually pushed to the brink. Prepared to throw it all away, he stands on the edge of a precipice and takes the leap. However, instead of falling to his death, he enters a trance where he meets a winged being who claims to be his guardian angel. Named Nasse, the angel offers him two priceless abilities and convinces him to go on living.\n\nWhen Mirai experiences the marvel of his new powers firsthand, he gets a taste of the freedom that was locked away from him for so long. Armed with Nasse\u0027s gifts, Mirai is flung into a showdown with 12 other individuals, one of which will be chosen to become the next God. In stark contrast to when he wanted to end his life, Mirai is now prepared to do whatever it takes to protect his bleak chance at happiness, lest it be wrenched from his grasp forever.\n\n[Written by
