However, he does not get to play the role of the protagonist, but instead he becomes the scumbag master destined to suffer a humiliating defeat.\n\nShen Yuan, now known as cultivation master Shen Qingqiu, makes it his mission to change his fate so that he does not fall to his disciple, Luo Binghe, the protagonist of the novel.

While it may seem impossible to apply scientific theory to such an intricate and complex emotion, a daring pair of quick-witted Saitama University scientists aim to take on the challenge.\n\nOne day the bold and beautiful Ayame Himuro outwardly declares that she is in love with Shinya Yukimura, her fellow logical and level-headed scientist. Acknowledging his own lack of experience with romance, Yukimura questions what factors constitute love in the first place and whether he is in love with Himuro or not. Both clueless in the dealings of love, the pair begin to conduct detailed experiments on one another to test the human characteristics that indicate love and discern whether they demonstrate these traits toward each other.\n\nAs Himuro and Yukimura begin their intimate analysis, can the two scientists successfully apply scientific theory, with the help of their friends, to quantify the feelings they express for one another?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.36,"Rank":2331,"Popularity":667,"Genres":[{"Id":50,"Name":"Adult Cast"},{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2020,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Saturday","StartTime":"00:30"},"Source":"Web Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1420,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":32217,"Completed":165781,"OnHold":13596,"Dropped":17586,"PlanToWatch":103769},"NumListUsers":332949},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T14:53:11.087+02:00"},{"Id":38993,"Title":"Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san 2","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1393/107033.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1393/107033l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Jul 07 2019","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2019,"Month":7,"Day":7},"EndDate":"Sep 22 2019","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2019,"Month":9,"Day":22},"Synopsis":"Even after spending a considerable amount of time with Takagi, Nishikata is still struggling to find a perfect plan to defeat the expert teaser.
