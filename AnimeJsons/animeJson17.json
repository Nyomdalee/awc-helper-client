What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal Titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.\n\nAfter witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Eren, his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman, and his childhood friend Armin Arlert join the brutal war against the Titans and race to discover a way of defeating them before the last walls are breached.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":8.54,"Rank":110,"Popularity":1,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":46,"Name":"Award Winning"},{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":58,"Name":"Gore"},{"Id":38,"Name":"Military"},{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"},{"Id":76,"Name":"Survival"},{"Id":41,"Name":"Suspense"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":25,"StartSeason":{"Year":2013,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Sunday","StartTime":"01:58"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1440,"Rating":"R","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":195015,"Completed":3310981,"OnHold":49816,"Dropped":58153,"PlanToWatch":166039},"NumListUsers":3780004},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-07T21:35:26.148+02:00"},{"Id":16506,"Title":"San Ge Heshang","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1580/116384.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1580/116384l.jpg"},"StartDate":"1980","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":1980,"Month":null,"Day":null},"EndDate":"1980","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":1980,"Month":null,"Day":null},"Synopsis":"The film is based on the ancient Chinese proverb \u0022One monk will shoulder two buckets of water, two monks will share the load, but add a third and no one will want to fetch water.\u0022 The film does not contain any dialogues.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","Mean":5.85,"Rank":9959,"Popularity":14938,"Genres":[{"Id":19,"Name":"Music"}],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":null,"Season":null},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Unknown","AverageEpisodeDuration":1181,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":19,"Completed":309,"OnHold":3,"Dropped":52,"PlanToWatch":144},"NumListUsers":527},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-07T21:35:34.334+02:00"},{"Id":16508,"Title":"Ebiten: Kouritsu Ebisugawa Koukou Tenmonbu Specials","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/44588.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/44588l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Nov 30 2012","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2012,"Month":11,"Day":30},"EndDate":"Mar 29 2013","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2013,"Month":3,"Day":29},"Synopsis":"BD/DVD specials.","Mean":5.95,"Rank":9527,"Popularity":8177,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":9,"Name":"Ecchi"},{"Id":20,"Name":"Parody"},{"Id":23,"Name":"School"},{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"}],"MediaType":"Special","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":5,"StartSeason":{"Year":2012,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":270,"Rating":"R\u002B","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":204,"Completed":2894,"OnHold":107,"Dropped":158,"PlanToWatch":1513},"NumListUsers":4876},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-07T21:35:36.709+02:00"},{"Id":16510,"Title":"Shin Shounan Bakusouzoku Arakure Knight","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/44652.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/44652l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Sep 12 1997","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":1997,"Month":9,"Day":12},"EndDate":"Sep 11 1998","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":1998,"Month":9,"Day":11},"Synopsis":"","Mean":null,"Rank":19944,"Popularity":13853,"Genres":[{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":55,"Name":"Delinquents"}],"MediaType":"OVA","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":2,"StartSeason":{"Year":1997,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":2580,"Rating":"R","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":48,"Completed":148,"OnHold":13,"Dropped":62,"PlanToWatch":452},"NumListUsers":723},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-07T21:35:38.43+02:00"},{"Id":16512,"Title":"Devil Survivor 2 The Animation","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/47191.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/47191l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Apr 05 2013","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2013,"Month":4,"Day":5},"EndDate":"Jun 28 2013","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2013,"Month":6,"Day":28},"Synopsis":"The countdown to extinction begins on Sunday with the arrival of the Septentriones, otherworldly invaders set on the eradication of mankind.
