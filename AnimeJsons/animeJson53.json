Once a creature is killed, \u0022sweepers\u0022\u2014working under the Professional Kaijuu Cleaner Corporation\u2014are left to dispose of its remains.\n\nKafka Hibino, a 32-year-old man, is unsatisfied with his job as a sweeper. From a young age, he has aspired to join the Defense Corps and kill kaijuus for a living. After a few failed attempts, however, he gave up on his dreams and resigned himself to the mediocrity that provided a decent paycheck. Nevertheless, when an ambitious, 18-year-old recruit named Leno Ichikawa joins his cleaning team, Kafka is once again reminded of his desire to join the military.\n\nFollowing a chain of unfortunate events and an interaction with the junior sweeper, Kafka encounters a parasite-type kaijuu that forces its way in through his mouth\u2014turning him into a humanoid monster. With his newfound powers, Kafka aims to give his lifelong dream a final try.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":null,"Rank":null,"Popularity":3208,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":24,"Name":"Sci-Fi"}],"ExplicitGenres":[],"Themes":[{"Id":38,"Name":"Military"}],"Demographics":[{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Not yet aired","NumEpisodes":null,"StartSeason":{"Year":2024,"Season":"Spring"},"Broadcast":null,"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":null,"Rating":null,"Statistics":{"Watching":0,"Completed":0,"OnHold":0,"Dropped":0,"PlanToWatch":43183,"Total":43183},"Favorites":407,"Producers":["TOHO animation","Shueisha"],"Licensors":[],"Studios":["Production I.G"],"Approved":true,"Theme":{"Openings":[],"Endings":[]},"AniDb":"https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime\u0026aid=17550","LastUpdated":"2023-08-30T19:22:26.553+02:00"},{"Id":52593,"Title":"JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: The Real 4-D Dio no Sekai","Picture":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1632/126456.jpg","StartDate":{"Year":2017,"Month":6,"Day":30,"Full":"2017-06-30"},"EndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null,"Full":"2017-06-30"},"Synopsis":"JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: The Real 4-D Dio no Sekai was a cinematic attraction at Universal Studios Japan, in celebration of both JoJo\u0027s Bizarre Adventure\u0027s 30th Anniversary and Shueisha\u0027s 2017 Universal Jump Summer event.\n\nThe attraction featured a CG-animated movie adapting the fight between Joutarou and Dio, presented as a 4D film.
