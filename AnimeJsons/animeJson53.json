Realizing that he will remain indifferent to her affections unless she does something about it, Tomo must find a way to knock some sense into Jun and open his eyes to what is right in front of him.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":7.84,"Rank":846,"Popularity":675,"Genres":[{"Id":4,"Name":"Comedy"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"},{"Id":23,"Name":"School"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":13,"StartSeason":{"Year":2023,"Season":"Winter"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Thrusday","StartTime":"00:30"},"Source":"Web Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":1420,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":51908,"Completed":183990,"OnHold":6230,"Dropped":9069,"PlanToWatch":77713},"NumListUsers":328910},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T19:21:49.097"},{"Id":52307,"Title":"Chibi Maruko-chan Pilot Film","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1952/125035.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1952/125035l.jpg"},"StartDate":"1990","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":1990,"Month":null,"Day":null},"EndDate":"1990","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":1990,"Month":null,"Day":null},"Synopsis":"","Mean":null,"Rank":18343,"Popularity":20548,"Genres":[{"Id":25,"Name":"Shoujo"},{"Id":36,"Name":"Slice of Life"}],"MediaType":"Special","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":null,"Season":null},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":63,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":8,"Completed":74,"OnHold":2,"Dropped":16,"PlanToWatch":18},"NumListUsers":118},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T19:21:51.493"},{"Id":52308,"Title":"Kanojo ga Koushaku-tei ni Itta Riyuu","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1109/130452.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1109/130452l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Apr 10 2023","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2023,"Month":4,"Day":10},"EndDate":"Jun 26 2023","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2023,"Month":6,"Day":26},"Synopsis":"When, after her sudden death, Rinko Hanasaki is reborn as Raeliana McMillan, she is not sure whether to curse her luck.

There, Taku meets Price Noman, and it\u0027s up to them and the Noman Rangers to put a stop to the intergalactic war between humans and aliens.\n\nThe pilot was partially in color, and ran for exactly 12 minutes and 20 seconds. It is unknown why the pilot was never serialized, but one could speculate that it was because of financial reasons. Another pilot made around the same time, Zero Man, was cancelled early into production due to Mushi Pro struggling to fund the show. Seeing as how the Noman pilot was nearly three times as long as the Zero Man pilot, it\u0027s easy to see how Mushi Pro would struggle financially with such a production.\n\n(Source: Lost Media Wiki)","Mean":null,"Rank":16070,"Popularity":20697,"Genres":[{"Id":1,"Name":"Action"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"}],"MediaType":"Special","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":1968,"Season":"Summer"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":720,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":11,"Completed":30,"OnHold":4,"Dropped":30,"PlanToWatch":34},"NumListUsers":109},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T19:23:23.274"},{"Id":52399,"Title":"0 Man","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1870/125395.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1870/125395l.jpg"},"StartDate":"1968","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":1968,"Month":null,"Day":null},"EndDate":"1968","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":1968,"Month":null,"Day":null},"Synopsis":"This sci-fi story centers around Ricky, a Zero Man raised by humans in Tokyo.

It is about the injury of rigid religious upbringing to a teenager who discovers the strange and terrifying reality behind fundamentalism.

He eventually succumbs to the madness, and lives consumed by guilt while devouring every crumb of false hope thrown at him from his religious community.

However, as the childish new queen foolishly abuses her power, Oscar is conflicted between maintaining her loyalty to the royal family and addressing the growing concern of poverty among the common people.\n\nRecalling the events of the French Revolution, Versailles no Bara depicts the struggles of two women unjustly burdened by family expectations. Yet, despite being forced to deny their identities at the expense of personal happiness, they march on to become key players in the annals of history. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":null,"Rank":null,"Popularity":9127,"Genres":[{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":13,"Name":"Historical"},{"Id":38,"Name":"Military"},{"Id":22,"Name":"Romance"},{"Id":25,"Name":"Shoujo"}],"MediaType":"Movie","Status":"Not yet aired","NumEpisodes":1,"StartSeason":{"Year":null,"Season":null},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":0,"Rating":"PG-13","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":0,"Completed":0,"OnHold":0,"Dropped":0,"PlanToWatch":3491},"NumListUsers":3491},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T19:33:04.628"},{"Id":52968,"Title":"Sylvanian Families: Mini Story - Peony","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1747/127711.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1747/127711l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Oct 01 2020","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2020,"Month":10,"Day":1},"EndDate":"Dec 17 2020","DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":2020,"Month":12,"Day":17},"Synopsis":"The story takes place in a village called Sylvania, and centers on Chocolate Usagi-chan, Kurumi Risu-kun, and their friends and families.\n\n(Source: ANN)","Mean":null,"Rank":13006,"Popularity":20650,"Genres":[{"Id":15,"Name":"Kids"},{"Id":36,"Name":"Slice of Life"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Finished Airing","NumEpisodes":12,"StartSeason":{"Year":2020,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":null,"StartTime":null},"Source":"Other","AverageEpisodeDuration":180,"Rating":"G","Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":6,"Completed":43,"OnHold":4,"Dropped":29,"PlanToWatch":30},"NumListUsers":112},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T19:33:05.34"},{"Id":52969,"Title":"Jitsu wa Ore, Saikyou deshita?","MainPicture":{"Medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1496/136558.jpg","Large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1496/136558l.jpg"},"StartDate":"Jul 02 2023","DeserializedStartDate":{"Year":2023,"Month":7,"Day":2},"EndDate":null,"DeserializedEndDate":{"Year":null,"Month":null,"Day":null},"Synopsis":"To be reincarnated into another world with the promise of a \u0022cheat\u0022 power is one thing... but to be reborn as a baby, and then left for dead after your royal parents think you\u0027re powerless??

Along their travels, Frieren slowly confronts her regrets of missed opportunities to form deeper bonds with her now-deceased comrades.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Mean":null,"Rank":null,"Popularity":2709,"Genres":[{"Id":2,"Name":"Adventure"},{"Id":8,"Name":"Drama"},{"Id":10,"Name":"Fantasy"},{"Id":27,"Name":"Shounen"}],"MediaType":"TV","Status":"Not yet aired","NumEpisodes":0,"StartSeason":{"Year":2023,"Season":"Fall"},"Broadcast":{"DayOfTheWeek":"Friday","StartTime":"21:00"},"Source":"Manga","AverageEpisodeDuration":0,"Rating":null,"Statistics":{"Status":{"Watching":12,"Completed":0,"OnHold":2,"Dropped":0,"PlanToWatch":58807},"NumListUsers":58821},"LastUpdated":"2023-08-09T19:33:28.819"},{"Id":52992,"Title":"Aikatsu Planet!
